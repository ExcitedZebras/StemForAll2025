Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

For the past year, our Palmetto Political Stock Index has tracked the rising and falling fortunes of national and state politicos ahead a pivotal “First in the South” presidential primary election. This election is now nearly upon us. In closing the book on 2023, we wanted to look back and see how some of the figures we’ve been tracking fared over the past twelve months – and to gauge what we can expect of them in the year to come.

Accordingly, for this week’s index we dispense with our traditional “ rising ,” “ falling ” and “holding” ratings and provide two entries for each subject: A 2023 performance review followed by a 2024 prospectus.

Our founding editor Will Folks and political columnist Mark Powell compile this index each week – tracking the interplay of state and national politics in our early-voting South Carolina home. Got a hot “stock tip” for our consideration? Email Will (here) and/ or Mark (here). Just make sure to include “Palmetto Political Stock Index” in the subject line.

As often noted, our index is simply an assessment of how our subjects fared over the past seven days. Positive reports don’t reflect endorsements, and negative ones aren’t indicative of vendettas. We just call ‘em like we see ‘em. Also, just because your favorite/ least favorite politician isn’t on this week’s report doesn’t mean we aren’t still tracking them. Look for them in upcoming editions … and, of course, you can check prior installments to see how we’ve covered them in the past.

New Year’s is a time when investors take “stock” of their portfolios. They review how certain shares did in the prior calendar year – and consider what lies in store in the year to come. The same holds true for your political portfolio as well. Where should you invest your political capital heading into 2024?

DONALD TRUMP

2023 PERFORMANCE

Ronald Reagan was nicknamed the Teflon President because few attacks stuck him. He now looks like the Velcro President compared to Donald Trump.

Trump defied all the odds in 2023 as Democrats threw everything but the proverbial kitchen sink at him – and still couldn’t knock him off his block. He became the first former president ever charged with a crime, with his signature scowl captured in the first-ever presidential mugshot. Trump now faces a total of 91 counts in four separate cases in three states and the District of Columbia – but is no worse for the wear in GOP polling. He skipped participating in all four Republican presidential debates – and similarly experienced no adverse affect. Finally, Democratic functionaries banned him from the GOP primary ballot in Colorado and Maine (although he’s been temporarily reinstated in the Centennial State as the Colorado GOP appeals that decision to the U.S. Supreme Court).

The more hits he takes, the higher Trump’s polling numbers rise among Republican primary voters.

There’s nothing new about Trump this go-round. Unlike Richard Nixon, who took an eight-year breather and rebranded himself as a “New Nixon” after narrowly losing the presidency in 1960, Trump 2024 is a carbon copy of Trump in 2016 and 2020. He is still lashing out at his enemies (both real and perceived), still harping on his 2020 loss, and still promising to stand up for the forgotten little guy. And his base is unflinchingly standing with him every step of the way.

2024 PROSPECTUS

Trump remains the favorite in the big three early GOP contests: Iowa’s Republican caucus (on January 15) and both the New Hampshire (January 23) and South Carolina (February 24) GOP primaries. If the former president runs the table and sweeps all three contests, the GOP nomination will be effectively decided.

The general election campaign would be an entirely different matter, however. If a Trump-Biden rematch materializes, it would be the last hurrah for both the then-78-year-old Trump and the soon-to-be 82-year-old Biden. With nothing left to lose for either candidate, the 2024 campaign has the potential to set a new low in nastiness.

Plus, there’s the very real possibility that Trump could be convicted in one of the quartet of cases now besetting him. What would a campaign waged from inside a prison cell look like? That may sound improbable now; but then again many of the challenges Trump faced this year seemed unlikely on New Year’s Eve 2022, too.

JOE BIDEN

2023 PERFORMANCE

The Democratic incumbent looked like political roadkill all year. With a nonexistent southern border, a wobbly economy that flirted with a recession, a vice president who became an increasingly burdensome albatross, a mouth that doubled as a perpetual gaffe machine, mounting disillusion and discontent among Gen Z and Woke/progressives, and approval numbers that rivaled Typhoid Mary, Joe Biden had all the hallmarks of a one-termer.

And that’s before we even consider questions about his cognitive stamina (or lack thereof).

Incredibly, Biden is still standing. Even more incredibly, he could conceivably win reelection next November.

Despite a spectacularly bungled rearranging of the Democratic primary calendar, Biden drew only one modest opponent (congressman Dean Phillips, more commonly known outside of his home state of Minnesota as “Who?”) The White House did an impressive job keeping all pretenders to the throne at bay. Foremost among them? California governor Gavin Newsom – who divided his 2023 between acting like a candidate in waiting and saying, “No, really, I’m not running, guys. Honest!” Even has-been Hillary Clinton dropped hints last summer that she was available for another run if needed.

The administration worked itself into a tizzy of excitement in December by declaring the worst of inflation was behind us. However, many economists quickly pointed out that while inflation is slowing from its earlier 40-year high, it hasn’t gone away. Meanwhile, the worsening border crisis – and an increasingly toxic strain of far left hatred over his administration’s position vis-à-vis the latest Middle East crisis – has Biden on the defensive.

Despite the incredible odds, though, Joe Biden lives to fight another day.

2024 PROSPECTUS

If he makes it to next August’s Democratic National Convention unscathed, if the economy somehow manages to roar back to life in the coming eight months, if the Gen-Zers and woke/progressive crowd can be appeased, if the world stage stabilizes and China holds itself in check and if (the biggest hope al all) Kamala Harris could somehow be coaxed into retirement and replaced with a more dynamic — and competent — running mate … if all those things fall into place, then Joe and Jill might not have to worry about returning to Delaware until 2029.

But that’s an awful lot of “ifs”

And keep in mind Barack Obama’s famous observation: “Don’t underestimate Joe’s ability to f*ck things up.”

NIKKI HALEY

2023 PERFORMANCE

Nikki Haley finally found a promise she can keep. “Nobody is going to outwork me,” the former South Carolina governor said when she jumped into the Republican presidential contest last February. True to her word, Haley has done yeoman’s work in the GOP vineyards in both the hinterlands of Iowa and New Hampshire. Unlike Trump – who jets from one rally to the next like a rock star heading to his next concert – Haley has tended assiduously to the nitty gritty mundane chores of modern retail politicking. She has talked to voters in school gymnasiums and in the living rooms of her local supporters. She had posed for thousands of photos with blue-haired ladies, college kids and anyone in between. In New Hampshire alone, she has held dozens upon dozens of town halls.

Haley did it the old-fashioned way – and now it’s paying off.

She did it with hard work, disciplined campaign messaging and three solid debate performances (we’ll forget the fourth debate where she drooped like a wilted flower for some reason). Throw in a sycophantic MSM that fawns over her as its new identitypolitik standard-bearer (now that Kamala Harris has crapped out) and a wealthy uni-party donor class eager for a malleable GOP nominee and it’s easy to see why Haley is on the upswing.

Consequently, Trump’s former UN ambassador has realized her tactical goal of coalescing most — though not all — of the #NeverTrump GOP electorate around her candidacy.

True, the same problems that have hounded Haley ever since her entry into politics (her lack of authenticity and, at times, her awkward attempts to have it both ways) continue to rear their ugly heads. She also stepped in it last week at a town hall in Berlin, N.H. when a blatantly obvious Democratic plant asked her what caused the Civil War. Failing to give the left’s preferred answer, the MSM turned the story into her first real national scandal.

Still, Haley enters 2024 poised precisely where she wants to be just two weeks away from the first votes being cast …

2024 PROSPECTUS

As we have noted in our coverage of her candidacy, Haley has very little to lose and a lot to gain moving forward. If she comes within striking distance of Trump in Iowa or pulls off an improbable (but not impossible) upset in New Hampshire, watch out. That would put her on a collision course with Trump on her home turf here in South Carolina.

Speaking of, we continue hearing reports that backdoor communications are taking place between Haley’s camp and Trump World. As Chris Christie pointed out late last week, “She’s afraid to say that Donald Trump is unfit because she’s afraid of offending people who support Donald Trump — and because maybe she harbors in the back of her mind being vice president or being secretary of state and since she won’t deny it, we have to believe that she’s willing to do it.”

Even if Haley doesn’t win the GOP nomination – or join a Trump ticket – she’s still exceedingly well-positioned politically moving forward. Regardless of what happens next November, Donald Trump won’t be in the race in 2028. As a leading contender this cycle – one who has exceeded expectations – Haley would find herself in prime position heading into the next presidential cycle. In other words, whatever happens in the coming year, she and her supporters will be hanging on to all those leftover ‘Haley for President’ buttons.

RON DeSANTIS

2023 PERFORMANCE

The Fat Lady may not be singing for Florida governor Ron DeSantis just yet, but she’s warming up in the wings.

Seldom in modern political history has a candidate burst onto the political scene with such bright prospects, only to flame out so spectacularly – and so quickly. Coming off his resounding reelection victory as governor in November 2022, DeSantis looked like a modern St. George poised to slay the Trump Dragon.

But looks were deceiving …

For starters, DeSantis committed a major strategic blunder at the outset. He delayed formally entering the race far too long. True, his reasoning was based on responsibility; no governor can afford to leave his state for long when its legislature is in session. Still, that commitment kept DeSantis tethered to Tallahassee for weeks on end.

Nature abhors a vacuum, and so does politics. Trump World brilliantly seized on DeSantis’ delay to plant seeds of doubt in the MSM’s mind. (For all of Trump’s “fake news” bashing, his organization knows how to play the national media like a violin.) Add to that the general anxiety among Republicans still stinging from the GOP’s less-than-dazzling performance in the 2022 Midterms. The longer DeSantis dillydallied, the more antsy they grew.

When he finally made a much-ballyhooed announcement with billionaire Elon Musk live on Twitter, a technical glitch marred the moment. DeSantis’ opponents had a field day mocking the debacle – which was a stupid decision in the first place as Twitter is beloved by Gen-Zers, Millennials, and the notoriously left-of-center MSM).

How many fifty-plus GOP primary voters avail themselves of the platform?

Then, there’s been a revolving door of turmoil at the top of the DeSantis campaign team that makes Trump’s White House look like a bulwark of stability.

But the biggest problem of all was painfully simple. DeSantis billed himself as “Trumpism without the baggage of Trump.” Trump supporters responded by asking, “Why would I want Trump Lite when I can have the real thing?” DeSantis never came up with an effective answer.

The result: DeSantis’ poll numbers have steadily slid downward since summer. It was like watching a family pet die in slow motion. As of this writing, the polling average at FiveThirtyEight showed him clinging to the second-place spot in the Republican race nationally by less than a percentage point over Haley – who now leads him in New Hampshire and South Carolina and is on the verge of catching him in Iowa.

2024 PROSPECTUS

It’s not quite time to write DeSantis’ political obituary in this campaign, but having the undertaker’s number on speed dial might not be a terrible idea.

What does the post-2024 future hold for Ron DeSantis? For starters, he must finish his second term as governor of Florida. After that, it’s hard to say. But this much is certain: American politics is filled with candidates who overcame failed presidential runs and eventually make it to the White House. Ronald Reagan waged a disastrous campaign in 1968, followed by a near-miss in 1976 – and eventually went on to landslide wins in 1980 and 1984. DeSantis bears watching – especially if he can learn from his mistakes.

CHRIS CHRISTIE

2023 PERFORMANCE

Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie’s 2024 campaign can be summed up in one word: Redemption. He ran against Trump in 2016, then made nice with him as president, said sweet things about him, and even served a stint as opioid addiction czar in 2017. But like so many others, his stay in Trump World was brief.

Now Christie is seeking atonement in the GOP Establishment’s eyes for his heresy. He’s using the 2024 primary campaign as a political baptism to wash away the taint of Trump. Christie made it clear the minute he barged into the race that his sole focus was taking down his erstwhile friend. And true to form, he’s been a one-trick pony ever since.

Yet here’s the thing: If Christie really and truly wanted to stick it to Trump, he could do so by dropping out now and encouraging his supporters to migrate over to Nikki Haley’s camp. That could conceivably make it possible for her to narrowly beat Trump in New Hampshire on January 23. But as Christie himself said in a new commercial released late last week, “I’m not going anywhere.”

Could more than mere animus for Trump be at work here?

2024 PROSPECTUS

As a former U.S. attorney and two-term governor of New Jersey, plenty of corporations will be willing to put Christie on their board of directors. So he needn’t worry about missing a house payment. But as far as politics goes, it’s “bye-bye, big guy.”

Or as the next politician on our list said in a recent debate, it’s time for Christie to “get the hell out of this race” and “enjoy a nice meal.”

VIVEK RAMASWAMY

2023 PERFORMANCE

A 38-year-old investor with a net worth approaching $1 billion , Vivek Ramaswamy caught the attention of conservative GOP voters with his willingness to say things traditional politicians were (are) unwilling to say. In an era when Americans yearn for authenticity, his quick wit and lack of a filter earned him a soft spot in many hearts on the right —along with the undying enmity of the GOP establishment.

Ramaswamy romped through the summer like a kid on Christmas morning, gleefully bashing woke insanity and the Biden administration’s complicit lurch to the left. He ranted and grinned and reeked of enthusiasm – and his debut on the national stage darn near stole the show at the first Republican presidential debate in August.

For now, that has been his high-water mark. The race’s big guns were swiftly trained on him. The second debate revealed that while many Republicans liked what the brash upstart had to say, he had skipped the grades where you learn practical political lessons and shot straight to the head of the class.

By fall, he had settled into the role of reliable bomb thrower (with his ability to get under Nikki Haley’s skin especially amusing to watch).

2024 PROSPECTUS

Now that he’s an officially established “name” in the political world (with a sizable portion of Republicans able to correctly pronounce “Vivek”), look for Ramaswamy to become an increasingly familiar face on Fox News or other media outlets. There’s no shortage of outrageous woke antics, so the soundbite machine of the self-styled anti-woke CEO should keep operating at full capacity for the foreseeable future.

And who knows; should Trump win a second term perhaps he’ll tap Ramaswamy for education secretary. Seeing him do battle with entrenched educrat elites would certainly be a show worth watching!

Just don’t hold us to it!

You can click the links for our previous predictions and see how we did for 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, and 2018.

So without further ado, here are our predictions for 2024.

1. A repeat from last year’s prediction, because it came true and will continue: “Biden will continue to abandon southern border control, and the surge of economic migrants from around the world will steadily rise to even more unprecedented numbers. Large migrant camps and relocation facilities will arise in blue states, with federal funding.”

2. The 2024 General Election will not be Biden v. Trump. One of them, possibly both, is not going to make it. The 2024 contest will be Kamala Harris (with Gretchen Whitmer as VP candidate —a “first” all woman ticket) versus Ron DeSantis (with Glenn Youngkin as VP candidate). Say hello to President-elect DeSantis.

3. Trump will be convicted in the Florida case. The others are a toss-up, but he likely will be found not guilty in the Manhattan, DC, and Georgia criminal cases.

4. Republicans will take the Senate, but lose the House.

5. Israel will finish off Hamas and other Jihadist terrorists in Gaza. There will be the gnashing of teeth in DC and Europe, but October 7 was too horrible for Israel to allow any other way. It’s “us or them” now. The pro-Hamas activists will get more aggressive, and there will be violence in the U.S., including on campuses, as they become more unhinged and frustrated. The main brunt of the military offensive will take another 30-60 days, but it will take several more months to complete as there will continue to be pockets of terrorist hit-and-run attacks and suicide bombings. Unfortunately, few of the remaining hostages will make it out alive.

6. DEI will not die, but an increasing number of red states will defund.

Predictions for 2024? I would love to pretend I have some idea of what is happening in this dumpster fire of a timeline, but I can predict with certainty that we will acquire more chickens, probably some more animals, and have a more successful garden than last spring, having learned a bit in the year since.

I predict an insane and highly annoying election season as our state-funded propaganda machine kicks into high gear. I don’t trust the polls or anything being fed to us en masse. I suspect it’s all being cooked and not to serve up something good.

But I do predict great opportunity to continue telling the truth, holding feet to the fire, and helping many, many people through our work and in our personal lives as the world continues to crumble under the weight of emboldened evil. We must purpose to be a light.

I continue to put my faith, hope, and trust in the Lord God Almighty, who keeps us safe and provided for regardless of the circumstances around us; His son Yeshua being a perfect sacrifice to atone for everything past and future. And so my heart and mind remain at peace. And we remain happy warriors in the battle against lies, evil, and corruption.

My prediction is simple: 2024 is going to be lit!

What a year it’s been! On the one hand, we have a world that is increasingly unstable politically and economically thanks to the Democrat occupying the White House, but on the other hand, there have been significant cultural and societal shifts. Also, one might easily and snarkily argue, thanks to the Democrat occupying the White House.

I expect these positive changes (or backlash, if you wish) to continue in 2024, with the evil, hyper-sexualized trans-groomer movement being finally cut loose from the sane, normalcy-seeking LGB part of the LGBT+; DEI will not die but will be renamed because that’s what Democrats do when they lose: rename their evil not giving a thought to the reason everyone rejects it; the deep-seated and truly ugly antisemitism that’s been unmasked among Democrats and their associated leftist “allies” will continue to fester and will continue to red-pill more and more Democrats who have long clung to the belief that Democrats are the “good people,” they’re so clearly not; the Bud Light effect had an impact, and that, too, will continue as more people realize just how debased the left and its “allies” truly are (Disney is also feeling the heat for its dive into sexualizing children and pushing a disgusting and racist woke agenda). This will continue as fed-up Americans just stop supporting with their wallet companies whose socio-cultural agendas are repugnant to them; and finally, the great national reshuffling will continue as people seek to live in states that are more in line with their own worldview, ethics and morality, and desire (or lack thereof) for liberty.

I support Israel with my whole heart and soul. What was done on October 7th was an indescribable horror, and it can never be forgiven or forgotten. Well, forgiven if there were actual repentance, I suppose, but I will leave that to God. I can only hope that the violence we saw that day in that Holy land is not repeated there. Or here. Or anywhere.

I’m terrible at predicting presidential elections. I was wrong in both 2016 and 2020, so I’ll leave that and just wait and see what happens.

I do know that whoever wins in November, the country will continue to be torn apart. If a Republican wins (Trump, DeSantis, whomever), there will be wide-spread rioting, burning, looting, and murder that will make 2020 look like a day at the beach. The rot in our federal government will protect these criminals because that’s their job these days, and state and local leaders and law enforcement will seek out anyone who dares to protect themselves in these (they will be blue) areas. We know the play, but it will be worse, much much worse, this year.

If a Democrat wins (Biden or Newsom, whomever), the country will be torn apart because few will accept such a result and the Democrat and his alphabet agencies will continue to target, persecute and prosecute, all political opponents, while destroying our military, energy access, and our ability to live our lives as a free people. Either way, it’s not good. The only safety is in red states these days, and even then, you have to be wary (see: pro-child sexual mutilation and pro-lockdown king DeWine in Ohio).

I see hope on the cultural front, but feel a great deal of despair on the political front. Republicans—for the most part, though there are (far too few) exceptions—are just too go along to get along for this historical moment, and without a staunch pro-America force pushing back just as hard on the Democrats’ evil, we are in trouble as a nation. Happily, I think that Andrew Breitbart was right, that politics is downstream of culture, so as long as we keep winning in the culture wars, we will eventually see results in our politics. Eventually.

1. Biden refuses to drop out of the race because he thinks he is doing a great job and that he alone can beat Trump.

2. Trump wins and the Democrats, who have spent the last several years talking about the importance of democracy, use multiple strategies to try to prevent him from taking office.

3. Leftists riot in Washington, DC and make January 6th look like a walk in the park. None of them go to jail.

4. After Trump takes office, inflation immediately drops and the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East are quickly resolved. The media gives Biden all the credit.

5. Taylor Swift breaks up with Travis Kelce and writes a song about what a horrible person he is. It goes gold.

I pretty much nailed the 2023 predictions I made last year, except for the one in which I said, “Candidates topping the presidential polls at the end of 2023 will be substantially different than who tops them currently.” It doesn’t appear either Biden or Trump are going anywhere.

I must admit, I am going into 2024 with a fair amount of apprehension. I fear the year will test my mettle, and that of many other patriots, before it is through with us.

However, being the optimist that I am, I will keep the prognostications positive.

1) I have noticed many more people are challenging the “climate change” narrative. I think this is a trend that is going to continue, as people are tired of being lectured may virtue-signalling elites who fly in private jets and eat gourmet food. Important industries are beginning to infiltrate their highly publicized meet-ups. I think we will see more counter-attacks by industries who have tried to go-along-to-get-along.

2) The Artemis mission to fly around the Moon and back will be successful, though their will be a delay in the date for the launch of the lunar landing mission.

3) Monkeypox will coming back this summer, bigger and badder.

4) The bottom will fall out of the covid vaccination rates, and Big Pharma stocks are going to take a big hit.

5) EV sales will continue to slow, as word-of-mouth about the real technical, maintenance, and cost issues related to their upkeep continue to spread.

6) I will have one new virus and one exciting volcanic eruption to cover at some point in 2024.

7) The Sun will undergo another year of spectacular activity.

I am wishing all our Legal Insurrection readers a healthy, happy, and prosperous 2024.

While still reeling from the shock of Hamas’ horrific barbarity towards innocent Israeli men, women and children on October 7, I will not venture to make big predictions on the unfolding conflict in the Middle East. I will, however, state the obvious.

In my predictions for 2023, I cautioned about the emerging ‘China-Russia-Iran Axis’ on the horizon. Iran has made no effort to hide its complicity in the October 7 massacre. The Mullah regime not only armed and funded Hamas for years, it gave tactical training to hundreds of terrorists fighters from Gaza for a cross-border incursion on its soil. As the IDF corners Hamas in Gaza, Iran is now directing Hezbollah to open another front on Israel’s north.

Iran, backed by ever-aggressive China and Russia, will continue to destabilize the Middle East with the help of its proxy Islamist militias. While the current White House leadership remains weak abroad and obsessed at home with its all-consuming agenda of wokeism, we will only witness the empowering of this China-led triad of tyranny.

If Trump wins the GOP nomination, he will pick Nikki Haley for his running mate, and Chris Christie will flip flop again and become a surrogate for Trump’s campaign.

1. The U.S. military will continue to degrade, both numbers-wise and in terms of

effectiveness. I’m not so concerned about forces already deployed, such as the

Navy’s two Carrier Strike Groups operating in the middle east, who are flying

every day and responding in real time to actual military threats to themselves and

the forces they are protecting. I am more concerned about the misery the personnel attached to those forces will face upon their return from deployment. Once they are back in the States, they will be subject to the full force of the military’s DEI/CRT agenda, with required, divisive CRT training a common occurrence. They will probably even be required to mouth support for such policies or face disciplinary action, and they will be subjected to the following:

BREAKING: The United States @SpaceForceDoD Has A New LT Colonel Who Is Suffering The Severe Mental Illness Of Believing He's A Woman! pic.twitter.com/bp2uoNkmTY — John Basham (@JohnBasham) December 30, 2023

This will make next years’ end-strength numbers even worse than they are now,

and will continue to drive down recruiting. As Kurt Schlichter says:

Why would anyone submit to this organization? You ask why recruiting is down? This kind of freak show nonsense. https://t.co/GjyeFRKv9v — Kurt Schlichter (@KurtSchlichter) December 31, 2023

2. The United States Supreme Court will uphold the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C.

§ 922(g)(8), which bars anyone subject to a domestic violence restraining order

from possessing a gun. That law had been challenged in a case called United States v. Rahimi, and during oral argument at the Supreme Court the Justices seemed to recoil from the idea that someone against whom a judge has issued a valid domestic violence restraining order should be carrying a forearm. For a good summary see SCOTUSBLOG’s coverage here and here.

3. The Supreme Court will not take another gun case for the remainder of 2024.

Taking Rahimi soon after they took Bruen, in which the Justices held that you have

a fundamental right to carry a firearm in public, the Court will take a break from

resolving the various disparate rulings that have emerged in the wake of Bruen to

allow these issues to “percolate” in the lower courts.

In practical terms, especially for New York residents like me, that means that the recent Antonyuk ruling handed down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which restricted carry in many public places (other than houses of worship), will stand and be the law of the land, so pay attention to the latest ruling before protecting your family in public. I do think the Supreme Court will take another gun case sometime in the following couple of years, probably in 2025 or 2026, because the post-Bruen courts are covering these concealed carry gun issues quite extensively.

4. I think a major “black swan” type of cataclysmic event will happen to one of the

candidates for President this year, and it will not be Joe Biden. I think he has the

full backing of the left-wing media and the DOJ/FBI, and he is perfect candidate

for the left wing: easily manipulable to go along with any of the latest outlandish

leftist plans for the destruction of the country, just good enough and capable

enough to satisfy Democrat voters against their better judgment, and backed up by an intolerably bad Vice President. And the House Republicans talk a good game but regularly fail to back it up, so I don’t think Joe Biden will be impeached. If he is, he will obviously be acquitted in the Senate, so the whole discussion is a moot point. I make no prediction about the outcome of the 2024 Presidential election, but I predict Republicans will lose the House of Representatives, but win the Senate.

5. The economy will continue to limp along as the banks and the rest of the

corporate establishment act to prop up the miserable state of affairs we have

suffered under to date. As long as there is a Democrat in the White House, the

powers that be will make sure that blame for a catastrophically bad economy does

not upset the apple cart.

6. The border situation will continue to worsen, and Biden will do just enough to

keep the situation from exploding into a nightmare that would endanger his

chances of reelection. But that doesn’t mean the current situation isn’t bad—it truly is and you should buy as many guns and as much ammunition as you can afford (and you should train and be ready to defend your family).

7. If any Republican defeats Joe Biden for the Presidency, there will be protests

that dwarf anything we saw with Black Lives Matter or the recent pro-Palestinian

protests, as all of the left-wing forces will align in an effort to overthrow the

election results. Those efforts will be unsuccessful, however.

The United States will stop Israel from fully achieving its objectives in Gaza, but only after Western countries take massive amount of Gaza refugees.

In Ukraine, Avdeevka will fall early next year.

The Argentinian economy will take off.

Donald Trump wins the GOP nomination and loses in the general—to whom I don’t know.

Our southern border will remain open, the drug epidemic will continue taking lives, but several Soros DA’s will be recalled.

Lately we’ve been turning and turning in that widening gyre the poet Yeats wrote about and Professor Jacobson recently cited. It’s one of my all-time favorite poems, but that doesn’t mean I find the prospect of those increasing oscillations the least bit pleasant.

It also means it’s more and more difficult to make predictions for the coming year, except to say that things will be dramatic and intense. But these are my efforts at forecasting:

(1) None of the many trials Donald Trump is facing will be completed prior to the primaries, the nomination, or probably even the election.

(2) Many people are predicting Biden will not be the Democrats’ presidential nominee in 2024. I agree that the Democrat movers and shakers would dearly love to figure out a way to make that happen without making things worse for themselves, and maybe they will succeed.

But I continue to think it’s very iffy. One reason is that Biden himself seems to really want to be the candidate again and will not go willingly. Another reason—and probably the most important one—is that they can’t figure out a good replacement willing to take the helm. The most obvious possibilities such as Newsom or Harris don’t poll well. And whether or not you believe the Democrats have the will and the ability to cheat their way to victory, there’s a limit to how much of the difference in votes they would be able to make up that way.

(3) Whatever the November election results are, they will be contested.

(4) The pressure on Israel to stop the war will be relentless, but Israel won’t yield. However, I don’t think they’ll manage to kill Sinwar. Like Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden before him, he will evade capture for quite some time.

I hope that 2024 will prove far better than 2023, and that all of you have a happy and healthy New Year!

I will predict that the next president will be Republican. If the world and nation continue to seemingly be spinning out of control, I don’t see how President Biden gets reelected. He looks weak and ineffectual. Which Republican? I have no idea.

President Joe Biden heads into the election year showing alarming weakness among stalwarts of the Democratic base, with Donald Trump leading among Hispanic voters and young people. One in 5 Black voters now say they'll support a third-party candidate in November.

In a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll, Biden's failure to consolidate support in key parts of the coalition that elected him in 2020 has left him narrowly trailing Trump, the likely Republican nominee, 39%-37%; 17% support an unnamed third-party candidate.

When seven candidates are specified by name, Trump's lead inches up to 3 percentage points, 37%-34%, with independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at the top of the third-party candidates at 10%.

The findings underscore the formidable political task the president faces this year to win a second term.

""I think he's done a reasonably sound job, but it's not been a 'wow' administration,"" said Michelle Derr, 55, a Democrat who plans to vote for Biden. The small-business owner from Alexandria, Virginia, a suburb just outside Washington, was among those surveyed. ""For me, it's disappointing that we have two old white guys in this race again. I want to look forward to the future.""

Biden now claims the support of just 63% of Black voters, a precipitous decline from the 87% he carried in 2020, according to the Roper Center. He trails among Hispanic voters by 5 percentage points, 39%-34%; in 2020 he had swamped Trump among that demographic group 2 to 1, 65%-32%.

US President Joe Biden steps off Air Force One upon arrival at Henry E. Rohlsen Airport in Christiansted, Saint Croix, on the US Virgin Islands, on December 27, 2023.

And among voters under 35, a generation largely at odds with the GOP on issues such as abortion access and climate change, Trump now leads 37%-33%. Younger voters overwhelmingly backed Biden in 2020.

The possible good news for the president is that much of the support he needs to rebuild has drifted to third-party candidates, not into the camp of his likely opponent. Twenty percent of Hispanic and Black voters, and 21% of young voters, now say they'll back someone other than the two main contenders.

Trump has the support of 12% of Black voters, precisely the percentage he received in 2020.

""Although Trump hasn't grown support among Black voters, he has closed the deficit because third-party voters come off of Biden's support among Blacks,"" said David Paleologos, director of Suffolk's Political Research Center. ""A young voter or a person of color voting 'third party' is a vote away from President Biden, and a vote away from President Biden is a vote for Donald Trump.""

The survey of 1,000 registered voters, conducted by landline and cellphone Tuesday through Friday, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

There is more potentially good news for Biden: Views of the economy are brightening. Now 29% say the economy is in recovery, a jump of 8 percentage points since the survey in late October. In the wake of positive reports on employment, inflation and the stock market, that's the highest level since August 2021.

To the frustration of the White House, though, the sunnier perception hasn't translated to higher support for the president − at least not yet.

Trump's temperature runs high on the enthusiasm thermometer

The challenge for Biden is to increase not only his support but also voter enthusiasm so his supporters bother to cast a ballot in November.

In the poll, 44% of Trump supporters describe themselves as a ""10"" on a thermometer measuring enthusiasm, the highest possible level. Among Biden supporters, fewer than half that number, 18%, call themselves a ""10"".

Trump has troubles in court amid preparations for two criminal trials in federal court and two in state courts, in New York and Georgia, on charges including trying to overturn a legitimate election and mishandling some of the nation's most sensitive documents after he left the White House in 2021. He's appealing decisions by a Colorado court and the Maine secretary of state to bump him off primary ballots based on a constitutional bar to officeholders who commit insurrection.

So far, those legal travails haven't dented the former president's political support.

""Donald Trump, he has integrity,"" said Joyce Masumoto, 78, a Republican from Orange County, California, who was called in the poll. ""Biden and the Democrats − always bringing up Donald Trump. He's not even doing anything and they're blaming things on himself.""

""I voted for him the first time around and I was happy with his presidency and voted for him a second time,"" said James Traylor, 45, Republican-leaning independent from Forney, Texas. He is a member of the City Council and vice president of property management for a real estate developer. Though he is considering a vote for RFK Jr., he would vote for Trump over Biden.

Trump, 77, is barreling into the election year with increasing command of the GOP nomination contest as well as his narrow lead over Biden in the general election. He's backed by 62% of likely Republican primary voters, a record high for him in the poll as the GOP field has shrunk.

Former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, at 13%, has edged into a distant second place over Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who continues his slide in support to 10%. Businessman Vivek Ramaswamy is at 6%, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie sits at 4%.

That said, Republican voters will begin to actually cast ballots this month, in the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 15 and the New Hampshire primary on Jan. 23. Both states hold the potential to surprise, especially in the Granite State. Trump now leads in New Hampshire at 44.1% in an average of recent polls by fivethirtyeight.com, with Haley at 25.7% and Christie at 11.1%.

Kamala Harris' standing lags among Black voters, young voters

On the Democratic side, Biden faces no significant challenge for the nomination. In the poll, 74% of likely Democratic primary voters support him. Nine percent back inspirational author Marianne Williamson and 2% Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips; 15% are undecided.

The president's problems loom in November, with the erosion of his coalition in the general election.

The Biden team has dispatched Vice President Kamala Harris as a natural emissary to university campuses, including some historically Black colleges. She is the first Black and Asian-American to serve as vice president, and at age 59 she is a generation younger than Biden, who is 81.

But the findings reveal difficulties she herself has with the Democratic base. She gets lower job approval ratings than Biden among Black voters, 56% compared with 68%. She lags Biden among voters younger than 35, too, at 27% compared with 32%.

Overall, Biden's job approval rating is 39% approve, 58% disapprove. Of those, 43% ""strongly"" disapprove and 13% ""strongly"" approve.

Harris' job approval rating is 33% approve, 57% disapprove. Of those, 40% ""strongly"" disapprove and 7% ""strongly"" approve.

""It's exciting to have a woman vice president; that's cool,"" said Sara Falls, 46, a high school English teacher from Oakland, California. ""But ... I don't really know what she's up to. What is she up to? What does she do? I don't know.""

Falls is likely to vote for Biden in November, but with some reluctance. ""He's not, like, my guy,"" she said. ""Bernie Sanders was my guy."" That would be the Vermont senator, now 82, who has led progressive causes and run presidential campaigns in the past.

No one expects President Biden to earn a mandate even if he wins re-election — it won’t be a victory for Biden so much as a defeat for Donald Trump.

Progressives don’t see Biden, or Kamala Harris, as an architect for the future.

A second Biden term promises an older, ever less vigorous president facing a world afire and a nation divided to the point of political divorce — with big Republican gains in the 2026 midterms, if history is any guide.

But what if Trump defeats Biden?

In a nonconsecutive second term, Trump will be as old as Biden is now, and he too would likely find the next midterms devastating.

Trump is more spry than Biden and may still personify his party’s ongoing evolution.

He’ll also have a fresh running mate come November, which should help his ticket appear future-oriented.

But the “lawfare” that mostly blue-state and blue-city prosecutors have been waging against Trump will continue if he wins, and the same media that hyped conspiracy theories about Russian collusion in his first term won’t be more fair the second time.

Paralysis seems inevitable.

The reasons for this transcend the parties and their leading personalities — these reasons are rooted in Americans’ changing beliefs about expertise and competence.

In an age when much of rural America didn’t have access to electricity, Franklin Roosevelt and his New Deal seemed like an expressway to the future.

From FDR all the way to Richard Nixon, presidents could rely upon Americans’ trust in technocracy.

It was a time when “I’m from the government, and I’m here to help” wasn’t yet a punchline.

But by the mid-1970s the federal government’s reputation for competence was in tatters, thanks to Vietnam, inflation, fuel shortages and monumental burdens imposed by rising taxes and overregulation.

The era of faith in federal competence thus gave way to an era of hope for a private-sector competence that would be unleashed if only government got out of the way.

This first took shape in the Jimmy Carter years, when a combination of blue-dog Democrats and Republicans in Congress pushed for deregulation.

Ronald Reagan’s presidency was the symbolic zenith of this new confidence in unleashing entrepreneurship, though just as Republicans like Dwight Eisenhower and Nixon testified to the epoch-defining influence of the New Deal mentality, Democrats like Bill Clinton would demonstrate, however reluctantly, the power of the new Reaganite dispensation.

Congress again played a leading role: Once the GOP won the House and Senate in 1994, sweeping reforms to welfare became possible.

By 1996, Clinton himself was announcing, “The era of big government is over.”

The truth is government expanded even as deregulation continued, but public confidence in federal expertise declined relative to faith in the possibilities of the “new economy,” represented above all by the telecommunications industry and the Internet.

But both parties soon changed their emphasis again.

George W. Bush didn’t campaign, or govern, as a slasher of red tape.

Instead his vision was one of competent collaboration between government and the private sector: what he called “compassionate conservatism.”

Barack Obama imagined much the same: Obamacare, after all, was about government creating rules for private insurance companies and their customers (who were, of course, forced to buy their products on pain of government-imposed penalties).

This new philosophy of government backfired spectacularly when instead of restoring faith in expert government, it exposed how incestuous the relationship between corporate America, both parties and higher education had become.

The result was the Tea Party — and Trump.

America was only partly industrialized when expert government first appeared capable of meeting any challenge.

And America was at the dawn of the information revolution when deregulation seemed to answer every question.

Today faith in expertise, public and private, is depleted — and as Harvard reels from its president’s plagiarisms, prospects for renewed confidence in the credentialed elite are bleak.

Instead of pretending to competence they do not possess, both parties would be better off learning to feel what other Americans feel.

Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Donald Trump, for all their differences, each sensed that empathy, not expertise, would be the key to victory.

Alas, Clinton’s empathy was only that of a seducer, while Obama’s elitism came to the fore as soon as he was elected.

Now the 2024 election hinges on Donald Trump’s emotional connection with the public — a balance of love and hate, trust and fear.

Biden is almost a bystander.

This isn’t a fluke, it’s the future: One way or another, the majorities of tomorrow will be built on emotional relationships, not new New Deals or retro-Reaganism.

The challenge, however, isn’t simply to win but to connect strongly enough to govern.

In a 24/7 news cycle, the media’s existence depends on churning out an endless stream of content — but the legacy media most prolifically creates non-stories. A non-story is a news story that should never have been reported, usually a triumph of “narrative” over facts that attempts to spin away some aspect of a bad story or magnify an otherwise insignificant good story. The non-story exists to massage the news, not to report the truth.

Here are 10 of the most overreported, non-stories of 2023.

1. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, “Christian Nationalist” Radical

From the moment Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.) won election as Speaker of the House, the media myth machine has attempted to paint him as a raving, theocratic radical bent on writing his biblical views into U.S. law at all costs. Their preferred pejorative, “Christian nationalist,” is an amorphous, nebulous, and essentially meaningless term. Yet no action seems too insignificant to feed the “Christian nationalism” narrative, no accusation profound enough to require journalists to examine the evidence before reporting it. Rep. Summer Lee (D-Pa.) erroneously linked Speaker Johnson, a man his colleagues say “radiates the love of Christ,” to multiple white supremacist mass shootings. Not to be outdone, Democratic consultant James Carville called Johnson and his fellow conservative Christians “a bigger threat than al-Qaeda.”

What did the media say, and how did they justify their charges? Time magazine printed an article by Andrew Whitehead and Samuel Perry on “The Christian Nationalism of Speaker Mike Johnson.” Their proof of Johnson’s theocratic leanings? He prefers “traditionalist social relationships” and once said America has “Judeo-Christian roots” (Which religion is Judeo-Christianity?). The New Republic pointed out that Johnson flies a flag emblazoned with the message “Appeal to Heaven,” a standard carried into battle during the Revolutionary War.

Politico interviewed Kristen Kobes Du Mez on “The Christian Nationalist Ideas That Made Mike Johnson.” That idea is summarized (in Johnson’s words) as saying that “America is the only nation in the world that is founded upon a creed … the Declaration of Independence,” and (in Du Mez’s words) that Speaker Johnson believes America is a republic, “founded in this biblical worldview, and that it’s not a democratic free-for-all. And so again, this is Christian supremacy.” (Du Mez may want to note Joe Biden made nearly identical comments to Johnson’s during last September’s “Dark Brandon” speech at Independence Hall.) Such fact-free reasoning may explain Du Mez’s participation in “God and County,” a hit piece helmed by Rob Reiner, that paints any churchgoer who opposes abortion as a “Christian nationalist.” The Southern Poverty Law Center’s new “Project CAPTAIN” similarly ties all opposition to the LGBTQ+ agenda or abortion to “white Christian nationalist ideology.”

Perhaps the most egregious example of this subgenre came from J.D. Wolf who wrote, in a video of a 2022 sermon, “Johnson can be seen nodding” as a speaker opposed the dehumanization, enslavement, or genocide of blacks and Jews. (MSN found Wolf’s story insightful enough to share it with its large platform.) Christians, and anyone with common sense, should be seen shaking their heads at the media’s attempt to stigmatize America’s founding documents, silence traditional believers, and condemn people of faith to a future of taxation without representation.

2. “Book Bans”

Facing plummeting approval ratings, Joe Biden took out his first campaign ad of the 2024 election season in April promising to support abortion-on-demand and oppose purported GOP efforts at “banning books.” (Biden’s commercial falsely implied Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R) banned “To Kill a Mockingbird.”) The legacy media built out the narrative that Republicans are holding open bonfires of disfavored books:

The Hill tallied “The five states with the most book bans” in April;

“Presidential hopeful DeSantis inspires push to make book bans easier in Republican-controlled states,” reported the Associated Press in May;

“Challenges to library books continue at record pace in 2023,” asserted the AP in September; and

“There have been attempts to censor more than 1,900 library book titles so far in 2023,” stated NPR (at your expense) in September.

In reality, the “book bans” in question forbid public school libraries from giving minors pornographic books — books which often contain graphic visual depictions of atypical sexual practices. Among the titles frequently found on this list are “Gender Queer: A Memoir” by Maia Kobabe, which includes explicit illustrations of a man having sex with an underage male, as well as fellatio and other sexual practices. Another “banned” book, “Lawn Boy” by Jonathan Evison, describes a fourth-grade boy fondly reminiscing about performing oral sex on an adult man. Some of the depictions are too graphic for TV networks. When DeSantis held up a picture from one such book during a debate with California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) in late November, the Fox News Channel’s cameras pulled away.

Parents, and society, have a vested interest in keeping pornography out of children’s hands and limiting underage exposure to porn in general. Unlike hardcore porn, these books are widely available at public libraries, to adults, or for purchase/donation. Keeping such books out of the hands of children no more “bans” these books than the Motion Picture Association’s “R” rating “bans” R-rated movies from the same age cohort. Parents can even expose their children to R-rated movies, if they wish — but no one else legally can. Perhaps that’s what triggers the Left.

3. The “Triumph” of Bidenomics

Although voters have felt economic pain most of President Biden’s term in office, he embraced the term “Bidenomics” this summer. “Bidenomics is working,” the White House announced in June. The media, too, said the economy had turned around and expressed shock the American people didn’t realize how good they have it. ABC News groused that “the American people aren’t giving Biden credit.” In fact, “Biden goes into 2024 with the economy getting stronger, but voters feel horrible about it,” said the Associated Press in December. The desire to portray a booming economy led NBC to run the unlikely headline, “Why Americans are going hungry despite a strong economy.”

It’s true the U.S. spent a record-breaking $119 billion on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, or “food stamps”) in 2022, thanks to Biden unilaterally enacting the largest benefit increase in the history of the program. (He raised SNAP benefits 21% in 2021, without Congress.) And even more American households use SNAP in fiscal year 2023. But food costs for all Americans have risen 25% since 2020 — 17% since Biden took office; the average American, who pays into, rather than takes out, federal food assistance, gets nothing. Gasoline, too, remains $1.17 a gallon higher than on nauguration day. Interest rates reached the highest level in 22 years (5.25-5.5%). The year-on-year inflation rate is still above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.

Wages have slowly begun to creep up, rising an estimated 13% since January 2021 — but that’s four points lower than the 17% inflation that has taken place on Biden’s watch, according to CBS News. In real dollars, the average American needs to earn an extra $11,400 a year to maintain the same standard of living he or she had in January 2021. Residents of the District of Columbia need to net a raise of more than $17,000 a year to stand still, according to Republicans on Congress’s Joint Economic Committee.

Until the economy begins paying dividends to the average American, Joe Biden would be wise to stop putting his mouth where your money isn’t.

4. Abortion Is a “Winning” Issue for Democrats

After staving off a big red wave in the 2022 midterms and putting the abortion-expanding Issue 1 over on the voters of the bellwether state of Ohio, liberals believe they have found their winning issue in 2024. Democrats and the legacy media (but then I repeat myself) say such state initiatives and local races prove their predetermined story that voters endorse the Democratic Party platform of taxpayer-funded abortion-on-demand until birth (or later). Some Republicans call for the GOP to find “consensus” by only protecting unborn babies who would die from late-term abortions.

But that’s not where abortion consensus may be found. In reality:

74% of Americans oppose funding abortion overseas, according to a KofC/Marist poll;

71% of the American people believe abortion should not be available past the first trimester;

63% of Americans oppose sending abortion-inducing pills through the mail;

55% of all Americans support laws protecting a child from his or her first fetal heartbeat; and

53% of Americans oppose forcing taxpayers to underwrite abortion in the United States.

Only 8% of Americans agree abortion should be “legal in any circumstances,” according to a Gallup poll. (Three times as many people believe abortion should be “illegal in all circumstances.”)

There’s no reason a pro-life candidate cannot win by comparing protections of the unborn against the Democrats’ unbridled abortion radicalism — unless the GOP wills the issue to go away by ceding the issue to the Left.

5. Ukraine “Defeats” Russia

The Washington Post explained in February, “Why Ukraine will win the war.” Politico ran an essay in June titled “Ukraine is winning — and it is changing.” As it turns out, it was authored by Dennis Shmyhal, the prime minister of Ukraine. Gaslighting readers about Ukraine is an international phenomenon as the U.K.‘s conservative newspaper, The Telegraph, also ran an article by former U.K. Defence Minister Ben Wallace insisting, even in October, “Ukraine is winning. Now let’s finish the job.” Yet a month later, The Economist claimed “Putin Seems to be Winning the War in Ukraine — for Now.”

The facts on the ground present a different picture. “Ukraine ends year in disappointing stalemate with Russia,” PBS reported. In fact, the stalemate has lasted for months, since Ukraine’s unsuccessful offensive this summer. “There is no clear breakthrough in sight,” stated The New York Times; indeed, “Russian forces have scored small territorial gains along Ukraine’s eastern front in recent weeks.” The news comes months after Ukrainain President Volodymyr Zelensky began drafting men as old as 60. He stretched this limit by sending a draft notice to Archpriest Dimitriy Sydor, the 69-year-old pastor of Holy Cross Cathedral in Uzhhorod. The elderly Christian leader belongs to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is officially disfavored by Zelensky’s government.

Whatever the battlefield situation, the American people want Congress to turn its focus back to the American people’s needs. “Overall, 55% say the US Congress should not authorize additional funding to support Ukraine vs. 45% who say Congress should authorize such funding,” reported CNN … in August. “And 51% say that the US has already done enough to help Ukraine while 48% say it should do more.” It’s a question of priorities.

6. Senator Tommy Tuberville “Hurt” Military Readiness

President Biden can prioritize Americans, when they donate to The Big Guy. After the Dobbs decision, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced the military would pay for pregnant soldiers stationed in pro-life states to travel to another state for an abortion.

Congress neither passed a new law nor repealed the Hyde Amendment, which arguably makes the Biden administration’s executive action illegal. Biden simply announced the new policy as a fait accompli, probably while daring Republicans, “Watch me.”

Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) chose not to watch or stand by. He placed a months-long hold on the blanket promotion of members of the military until the Defense Department changed its policy. Biden, in return, asserted that Tuberville’s actions were “harming military readiness, security, leadership, and troop morale.” White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre chimed in, “The senator’s action and the failure on the part of the 48 Republican senators to do something about it are dangerous. They are harming our military readiness.” But in reality:

“Senator Tuberville’s unanimous consent hold on general and flag officer nominations, which went into effect March 8, slows but does not ban the promotion of officers. Rather than approving all such promotions in a batch, senators can approve each of the approximately 250 affected officers individually. 'It only takes a couple hours per nominee. We could knock these out one [by] one, but Chuck Schumer doesn’t want to do that,’ [Republican U.S. Senator Mike] Lee [of Utah] revealed. That confirms Senator Tuberville’s account of Democratic inaction, who said he had only one 10-minute phone conversation with Secretary Austin since last December. The Biden administration has ‘made absolutely no effort to find a compromise in our situation,’ he told The Daily Signal in June. Democrats seem to enjoy ‘using Tuberville as a whipping boy too much’ to give it up, Lee told Perkins. If Biden would back down from his decision to compel government-funded abortion travel, ‘We could lift these holds, get these people confirmed immediately, like today.’”

7. Electric Vehicles Will Save Us

Jet-flying global elites long ago decided you must sacrifice in order to meet their goals. “Meeting the [p]resident’s goal of net zero emissions by 2050 will require large-scale adoption of electric vehicles (EVs),” said a White House document released in December. To make the Spartan life they have planned for you more palatable, they claim this will improve the economy — and force taxpayers to invest accordingly.

The Biden administration dedicated $12 billion in loans and grants to convert U.S. auto plants into EV plants — including $2 billion in handouts of your tax dollars to enormous corporations. Biden dedicated another $3.5 billion to help build EV batteries, which CNN notes, “comes as Biden tries to win over the powerful United Auto Workers union, which has thus far withheld its endorsement of his reelection bid.” It’s hard to know what this money will accomplish. The Biden-Harris administration set aside $7.5 billion from the “Bipartisan Infrastructure Law” in 2021 to build electric chargers — but as Politico reported, “Two years later, the program has yet to install a single charger.”

But if consumer sentiment is any indicator, Biden may as well save our money: The American people do not want electric vehicles. A Washington Post poll found more than twice as many people want traditional, gasoline-fueled cars and trucks than any other alternative, leading the Post to fret that “a hesitant American public … could still hold the country back.” (If the government is preventing the majority of Americans from doing what they want, who’s holding whom back?)

Americans are voting against the Democrats’ EV Utopia with their dollars. Ford lost $2.41 billion on its EV unit in just two quarters this year. General Motors lost $1.5 billion on EVs in a single quarter. “EVs were supposed to be the answer. Now they’re the problem,” reported Barron’s. Economist Steve Moore said, “We’re going to see the EV market become the next big flop, because car buyers don’t want them.” In November, nearly 4,000 car dealers asked the Biden administration to back off its EV obsession. “The supply of unsold BEVs (battery electric vehicles) is surging, as they are not selling nearly as fast as they are arriving at our dealerships — even with deep price cuts, manufacturer incentives, and generous government incentives,” they wrote. “With each passing day, it becomes more apparent that this attempted electric vehicle mandate is unrealistic based on current and forecasted customer demand. Already, electric vehicles are stacking up on our lots which is our best indicator of customer demand in the marketplace.”

Instead, in November, the Biden administration offered Americans a chance to win a total of $13,500 by sending a video of themselves with their electric vehicle to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A month later, House Republicans listened to Americans, voting to block Biden’s decree rule to shift to EVs by 2032.

Some Democrats are beginning to see the light. On December 21, the Maine Board of Environmental Protection planned to adopt a California-style plan requiring electric vehicles and hybrids to make up 43% of all new car sales for 2027 models and 82% by 2032 — but it had to cancel the vote due to a massive power outage. “Forcing Mainers to purchase cars and trucks powered by electricity when our grid is insufficient, charging stations are few and far between, and a storm like yesterday’s would render 80% of cars useless is, to say the least, ill-advised,” said Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine).

When Americans consider whether to shift to EVs, they should remember the Maine.

8. Letting Americans Vote Poses a Threat to “Our Democracy”TM

Every four years, Democrats discover a new threat to American democracy, who just happens to be the Republican presidential candidate. Yet no candidate sends the Left into bouts of fear-driven hysteria quite like President Donald Trump.

If voters elected Trump next November, “American democracy could be over,” vouched MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough on December 18. “He will imprison, he will execute, whoever he is allowed to imprison, execute, drive from the country.” Scarborough, a former Republican congressman, is outranked by fellow MSNBC commentator Claire McCaskill, a former Democratic senator — both in rank and hyperbole. “A lot of people have tried to draw similarities between Mussolini and Hitler” and Donald Trump, said McCaskill on November 21. “The difference, though, I think, makes Donald Trump even more dangerous, and that is he has no philosophy he believes in.”

Yet the Left mirrors the tactics of the brownshirts — attempting to imprison Trump in a desperate effort to keep his name from appearing on the ballot. Now, the Colorado Supreme Court has decreed democracy is too precious to be trusted to voters. By a 4-3 vote, the court’s Ivy League graduates issued a 133-page, unsigned opinion declaring “Trump is disqualified from holding the office of president under section 3 of the 14th Amendment” for allegedly inciting an insurrection on January 6, 2021.

In reality, Trump has been convicted of no crime; Trump has done nothing violating the legal definition of “incitement”; and the Civil War-era provision to prevent Confederate soldiers from returning to office may not apply to the presidency (nor to dozens of former Confederates who served in Congress after federal legislation repealed the prohibition). If Democrats are illegally attempting to prevent voters from choosing the candidate of their choice, who’s a threat to democracy?

9. Democrats Are Losing Minority Support

Not only legacy media outlets promote non-stories. Numerous conservative outlets have trumpeted polls showing minority groups’ support for Joe Biden declining.

It’s true that black and Hispanic voters have — just as they did at roughly the same point in Barack Obama’s presidency. Between April and September 2011, black support for Barack Obama fell by 28 points — from 83% to 58%. Obama went on to win 93% of the black vote in 2012. Eight years later, Joe Biden claimed 87% of the black vote, 65% of the Hispanic vote, 64% of self-identified LGBT voters, and 61% of the Asian vote. This September, Trump had the support of only half of registered Hispanic Republicans, according to a Univision poll.

Optimistic stories about Republicans carrying off a Reagan-style landslide that sweeps up the black, Hispanic, and Asian vote are fake news. They take for granted that the polls’ size and sample accurately reflect niche demographics. They assume “pale, male, and stale” Joe Biden will be the nominee. And they forecast a voting change virtually unprecedented in previous election cycles.

10. Republicans ‘Pouncing,’ ‘Seizing,’ etc.

It’s a classic media move: When anyone accuses a liberal of a scandal, the media attack the accuser. Often, the media assert, the critics “pounced” on an individual, whom they often note has received online harassment or “threats” to maximize public sympathy.

Joe Biden has more gaffes than most presidents, so the media have run this angle more often in 2023, with headlines such as:

An unbiased media would have thought the most salient parts of these stories are that the Biden administration let a Chinese spy balloon float over the entire country unmolested and transmit sensitive information to the Chinese Communist Party; that President Biden visited Ukraine and Palestine but not East Palestine, Ohio; that the president’s son was indicted for selling access to the White House while his father was vice president; that campus curricula promoting intersectionality and critical race theory led to an outbreak of anti-Jewish sentiment; and that school administrators appeared to lie about an underage girl’s sexual assault, so they would not derail their transgender bathroom policy.

Or am I pouncing on the media by pointing this out?

Yet eleven months in advance — subject to change, but not easily — that spectacle is just what we’ll get.

Such a prospect, along with Trump’s criminal trials and Biden’s policy stumbles, may help explain a peculiar popular climate of simultaneous political agitation and apathy. Many millions of voters including working-class people (aside from Trump cult loyalists) will find themselves voting for presidential candidates and political parties they despise the least, not for choices they actually like.

This malaise, rather than any hopeful excitement, also accounts for why the anti-vax and racist certified crackpot candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is polling as high as 24% as an independent, or why the rightwing Democratic Senator Joe Manchin might undertake a “No Labels” third-party campaign to “mobilize the middle” that could throw the election any which way.

No one should underestimate what a revived Trump presidency might mean — with his operatives’ overt, already promised concentration/deportation camps to be constructed for asylum seekers, forced removals of students for pro-Palestinian activism, targeted attacks on the press, mass firings of government employees to be replaced by regime loyalists, wholesale pardons for the January 6 aspiring insurrectionists, and who-knows-what chaos in imperialist global management.

The campaign of Trump’s emerging leading Republican rival Nikki Haley has been endorsed (purchased) by the Koch Brothers’ “Americans for Prosperity” (Plutocracy) outlet. This represents an attempt to consolidate a grossly reactionary, but more establishment neoconservative alternative to the runaway criminality of Trump and his prospective second term. That option would surely have appeal to much of the U.S. capitalist ruling class. (One rightwing commentator, Nolan Finley in the Detroit News, urges that Haley become the “No Labels” candidate.)

Activism and Ironies

To avoid a one-sided overly bleak portrayal, we should cite positive cases of social action that have made a difference. First, as we’ve discussed frequently, is the labor activist revival, culminating in union contracts with big gains for auto workers, at UPS, and steps forward in organizing places like Tesla and Amazon.

Second, at the present critical moment, is the outpouring in the streets demanding a ceasefire in Israel’s war against Gaza and Palestine, which we discussed in our previous issue (ATC 227, “Catastrophe in Palestine and Israel: Apartheid on the Road to Genocide”) and continue our coverage in the present issue.

Third is the continuing popular revulsion against the cynical and deeply evil anti-abortion extremism of the right wing, which is prepared to sacrifice women’s lives to the “pro-life” cause, along with book bans and state-level voter suppression measures.

Such examples show that class and social movements continue — as also shown by myriad state, local and community struggles, including around abortion, trans and housing justice among other issues. The fact that these are not generating much positive energy at the level of national electoral politics is one indication of a deformed and dysfunctional political system.

In this space we will not attempt to prognosticate, or chew over polling data, or (for the moment) seriously approach the prospects of an independent progressive alternative. The latter, critically important possibility must be a topic for future in-depth discussion. Here we want to explore some of the multiple ironies at the beginning of the electoral season.

If there’s one policy arena where Biden-Harris admin­istration should get at least passing marks and maybe some plaudits, it would be the general health of the post-pandemic economy. Yet that is exactly where polls show “greater confidence in the Republicans” — whose policies have been the most blatantly to enrich-the-rich, impoverish-the-poor, and run-up-deficits while pretending to be fiscally responsible.

It’s an astonishing public-relations triumph of plutocracy posing as populism. Democratic pundits and operatives are visibly distressed that “Bidenomics” fails to garner the approval it deserves. The reasons for this apparent anomaly go far beyond its mediocre “messaging.”

It’s true that this administration came in with a Build Back Better program that had some inspiring, even transformative potential (even if much of it came cloaked in nationalist rhetoric about countering the rise of China). As it emerged from the desk of Bernie Sanders and the ambitions of Green New Dealers, the program included some serious federal spending — on infrastructure and energy transition — amounting to something like half the annual military budget.

Thanks to Senator Manchin among others, the best part of the program was trimmed back to what became the Inflation Reduction Act. For example, pandemic-relief subsidies that cut U.S. childhood poverty in half — a very significant accomplishment in this brutally unequal society! ran out. Thus in Manchin’s own state — according to official Census Bureau’s estimates, West Virginia’s child poverty rate — the highest in the nation — increased from 20.7% to 25.0% between 2021 and 2022.

Most important, the measurable benefits of the recovery flow overwhelmingly to the high-income layers of the population, who need them the least. Folks at lower-middle income or less levels see very little if any difference in their daily lives.

Inflation levels are well down from their brief eight-percent high point, but that still leaves prices of basic necessities far higher than they were — while the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate hikes that were ostensibly needed to “curb inflation” have themselves exacerbated a housing crisis that especially afflicts young people (and many limited-income senior citizens too).

The cumulative result is that macroeconomic statistics for the moment look reasonably good, but for many tens of millions of people the real-life economy doesn’t feel that way. That hurts the electoral prospects for an incumbent administration, i.e. for Biden in 2024 as it did for Trump in 2020.

Further Irony: Demographics

If there’s one factor that should be pushing the Republican Party toward permanent marginality even as it hurtles toward extreme-right lunacy, it’s that the United States is demographically becoming no longer a “white” country, and that younger generations are each more diverse than the previous one.

It’s precisely young, African American and other non­white and immigrant communities, and the LGBT and non-binary population, who are the front-line targets of white-supremacist, Christian-nationalist and religious-right ideologies that thoroughly dominate today’s Republican Party — including of course the Trump cult but not only that sector.

Yet it’s precisely those younger, less white and less affluent sectors where the Democrats’ presumptively overwhelming majorities are narrowing. Polls are showing nearly a quarter of African Americans preferring Trump over Biden, an astonishing (even if it turns out to be short-lived) index of disillusionment.

What’s happened? Mainly, we think it’s that the Democrats have overpromised and under-delivered real change — in terms of racial justice, student debt relief, immigration reform, tackling climate change, and more. Partly too, it was only a matter of time until the feeling of relief from the (first) Trump nightmare wore off.

To some extent, also, Biden’s age and immovability present a bad look. But on key issues that are really hurting the Democrats’ prospects in 2024, it’s not Biden that’s senile, but American policy.

This is particularly illustrated in the present Israeli genocidal war on Gaza. The crucial young sector of the Democrats’ voter base is increasingly sympathetic to Palestine, alienated from the party’s traditional unquestioning support of Israel, and no longer duped by feeble bleats about a long-dead “two-state solution.” The December 1 resumption of the full-scale Israeli offensive, along with escalating murderous military and settler violence, accelerates that deepening and absolutely necessary disgust with Washington’s active complicity in the massacre.

As for the Arab American and Palestinian communities, the fury over “Genocide Joe” Biden is difficult to describe if you haven’t witnessed it. Leaders in communities like Dearborn, Michigan, a key to the Democratic success in 2020, are openly vowing “we will never vote for Biden again even if the alternative is worse.” It’s impossible to say right now how this feeling will translate into votes or non-votes next November — keeping in mind the maxim that “all politics are local” — but the Democrats are willfully blind if they underestimate its importance.

Another factor that will require close further attention is the flood of bipartisan money from AIPAC (American Israel Public Affairs Committee) and rightwing sources to defeat progressive, pro-Palestinian congressional representatives like Rashida Tlaib (MI), Cori Bush (MO) and Ilhan Omar (MN) in their primaries. AIPAC has been promising to throw $20 million toward any candidate who’ll challenge Tlaib. Any Democratic leadership connivance in these efforts could have fatal electoral consequences.

Immigration Crisis

Another issue bedeviling the Biden administration, clearly, is the immigration and asylum crisis. This is a powerful case of imperialism creating a problem it can’t solve. The numbers of desperate refugees and asylum applicants seeking entry at the southern border are overwhelming U.S. and northern Mexican cities, towns and support networks attempting to shelter and feed them.

The refugee crisis is a thoroughly bipartisan product of decades of destructive policies that we’ve discussed in these pages: decades of “free trade” that’s wiped out much of family farming in Mexico, genocidal counterrevolutionary wars in Central America, economic sanctions that greatly contribute to the unraveling of Venezuela as well as Cuba, serial catastrophic interventions in Haiti, and more.

Worst of all, 50 years of an insane U.S. “war on drugs” could not have been more brilliantly designed to turn the drug trade over to violent criminal cartels while shattering lives and communities in North America. On top of all this, the escalating effects of climate change are wiping out means of subsistence such as, for example, coffee crops in Honduras. We’ve noted before that desperate immigration journeys and calamities are global in scope, as the miseries in the Mediterranean and cruelties of the Italian, British and other European governments illustrate.

This crisis eats away at domestic confidence in the Biden administration’s grip on policy, even though it’s not of their making — and even though the “alternative” is the outright sadism of the Republicans.

A freshly passed Texas law enables local police to arrest suspected “illegals” on any or no pretext, and local courts to initiate detentions and deportations. In usurping clear federal jurisdiction over immigration, this law is so blatantly unconstitutional in its application, and so fascistic in its implications, that only the prevailing White Supremacy Court of the United States (WSCOTUS) majority would seem likely to uphold it. (The ACLU is mounting court challenges before the law takes effect in February.)

There remains one area where the right wing and the Republican Party seem determined to self-destruct: their drive to complete the banning and criminalizing of abortion in the United States. In one state after another, where the right to abortion comes to a choice by voters, it wins — decisively. The horrific implications of a Republican sweep of the White House and Congress will keep not only women but a big slice of the entire electorate on side with the Democrats. The Republican determination to continue a losing anti-abortion crusade is rooted in the centrality of that issue to the overall “culture war” assault on gender, racial and social literacy — in libraries, schools, college campuses, and everywhere else.

That specter might, just barely, preserve the Democrats’ grip on power after a looming 2024 election choice that hardly anyone outside the Trump cult actually wants. That’s a pretty weak reed to grasp, and certainly nothing for a progressive left to bank on. The struggle for an alternative must look elsewhere, beginning with the rising activism we’ve seen for labor, for Palestine, for immigration and reproductive justice!

Why This Election Is Different: The Chaos Narrative

It’s finally election year, and if you are sick with anticipation, you have good reason. This will be the ugliest election of our lifetimes by far—sordid, corrupt, and dishonest beyond decent people’s ability to imagine it right now. It will also be inescapable. Every week—and in time every day, and by the home stretch nearly every hour—will bring a development, some action or statement by Donald Trump or one of his supporters, that will drive the millions of us who care about the life of our democracy into states of deep despair.

Joe Biden and the Democrats will be tasked with a challenge that no U.S. presidential campaign has ever confronted. They, as Democrats—and more to the point as small-d democrats; that is, believers in the basic principles of American republican democracy—will be the first American political candidate and party in our history running against an openly fascist candidacy. Some will disagree with that designation regarding Trump and his MAGA movement. But for many of us, we’ve seen enough: Trump’s rhetoric about clearing out the “vermin” and the leaks from his camp about his second-term plans to weaponize the federal government against his enemies more than satisfy the definition. Most of us never thought we’d be here. And yet, here we are.

The animating concept behind the Trump campaign will be chaos. This is what history shows us fascists do when given the chance to participate in democratic political campaigns: They create chaos. They do it because chaos works to their advantage. They revel in it because they can see how profoundly chaos unnerves democratic-republicans—everyone, that is, whether liberal or conservative, who believes in the basic idea of a representative government that is built around neutral rules. Fascism exists to pulverize neutral rules. Indeed, fascism insists that republican democracies’ rules are not neutral at all but are rigged against them—the holders of an old, mythic truth that republican democracy was conjured into being to weaken and obscure.

So they campaign with explicit intention to instill a sense of chaos. And then comes the topper: They have the audacity to insist that the only solution to the chaos—that they themselves have either grossly exaggerated or in some cases created!—is to vote for them: “You see, there is nothing but chaos afoot, and only we can restore order!”

Trump teased this argument in 2016, with his “I alone can fix it” convention speech. This year, the chaos narrative won’t be just a theme of his campaign. It will be its animating force. The argument will center around crime, the border, racial politics in the schools, the rights of transgender Americans, and whatever else he can cram into the narrative that America has lost its way and can be saved only by discarding the democratic rules that have enabled “the Communists, Marxists, fascists, and the radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country” to flourish.

His rhetoric will get wilder and wilder, as it did with his purported Christmas message to Americans, which included the holiday wish that Biden and special prosecutor Jack Smith, and really anyone who isn’t MAGA, may “rot in hell.” And imagine what those rallies will be like in September and October—especially if he has been convicted of a crime or two.

This will all be unlike anything that any living American has seen. And shockingly, it’s unclear that Democrats can make Trump’s openly fascist appeal a voting issue that your average swing voter will care about. Unfortunately, the Democrats’ problems hardly end there.

2. The Democrats’ Other Challenges

It would be one thing if fending off Trumpian chaos were the only challenge Biden and the Democrats faced. Unfortunately, they confront a number of other problems. I count four big ones.

First, far from coming together to defeat a fascist threat, as one might expect, the Democratic Party is splintering into factionalism. This begins with the centrists behind the No Labels movement. Just before Christmas, they did something absolutely gobsmacking, which got very little attention because of the timing. In a December 21 briefing for reporters, No Labels officials floated the possibility of forming a “coalition government” with one of the major parties in the event that no candidate for president receives 270 electoral votes.

Put that way, it sounds relatively benign. It is, however, anything but. No Labels chief strategist Ryan Clancy explicitly mentioned, according to NBC News’s account, the possibility that the election could be tossed to the House of Representatives, where deals could be cut to determine a winner. This has happened before, in 1824 (also in 1800, but 1824 is the relevant case). Those who know their history will recall that this exercise in horse-trading, in which Henry Clay threw his support to John Quincy Adams and became his secretary of state, has gone down in political lore by the name the “corrupt bargain.” And No Labels is bragging about emulating it!

And with which candidate? Well, hypothetically, the group might cut a deal with either camp (although No Labels leaders have also repeatedly said that they will do nothing to help Trump win). But No Labels co-founder and former GOP Representative Tom Davis told reporters: “It could be, for example: ‘We’re going to build a border wall [and] not run deficits.’ Any number of things.” Gee. Which candidate might he have in mind?

Add in political gadflies Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West, and you have a clear recipe for a Trump win. Real Clear Politics is giving Kennedy about 16 percent and West nearly 4. That gives Trump a 39–32 lead over Biden. That would produce one of two outcomes. First, a narrow Trump Electoral College win, even while he loses the popular vote, which is likely. Or second, on the off chance that some candidate—say, Joe Manchin or Larry Hogan, who are floated as possible entrants—actually wins a state, keeping Biden and Trump below 270, you arrive at the No Labels–driven “contingent election” scenario where the House of Representatives steps in to decide the winner.

That vote would be taken by the next House, not the current one, with each state casting one vote (that’s right—Wyoming’s voting weight would be equal to California’s). In the current House, Republicans control 26 state delegations, Democrats 22, and two are tied (the District of Columbia, though it is represented in the Electoral College, would have no role here). It is extremely unlikely that the Democrats will emerge from the election with control of 26 House delegations. So in a scenario in which a contingent election decides the winner, the result would likely put Trump back in the White House. That this will be the inevitable end result of their caper is something that No Labels well knows. It’s an open question if any of their media interlocutors, who’ve proven to be good at whistling past democracy’s graveyard, are willing to call them out on it.

Finally, the Democratic Party now faces an inevitable generational implosion over Israel-Palestine. If they’re lucky, it might not happen this year. If the war doesn’t last much longer; if Israel gets a new and less radical government; if that government is talking with some representative Palestinian organization about two states, then perhaps the disagreements that exploded into view after Hamas’s October 7 attacks might be papered over for November. But if Bibi Netanyahu drags this war out, he hands Biden a terrible Hobson’s choice—stick with Israel and risk alienating young voters by the millions, or punish Israel (attach conditions to its aid, say) and risk alienating the older Jews who vote Democratic to the tune of 70 percent. And since Netanyahu obviously would prefer to have Trump back in the White House because Trump will hand him a blank check, why would he not do this? And should I even mention the possibility of a wider war that involves Hezbollah and Iran, and possibly the United States more directly?

All that is just the first of my four challenges. I’ll describe the other three more succinctly.

The second big challenge is a hostile media landscape that the Democrats have shown they haven’t figured out how to handle: either how to build narratives that effectively counter the relentlessly negative ones created by the right-wing media or how to communicate their accomplishments effectively. This will get far worse this year. The terrific new cover story in our January-February issue by Nina Burleigh goes into detail about the ways in which Fox News (and its imitators) will act as a second Biden opponent—and her reporting shows Democrats deeply split on how to handle it.

The third challenge is the way Democrats are losing their connection to Latino and Black voters, especially men. This too seems unbelievable to white liberals—that these voters would be embracing an openly racist Republican. But they are. Or at least they’re rejecting Biden. Democrats have 11 months to right this, so maybe it isn’t panic time. But somehow the polls just keep getting worse.

Fourth and finally, there is Biden’s age, combined with the presumed presence of Kamala Harris on the ticket. There is little to be done about Biden’s age except hope that he stays healthy and doesn’t have a senior moment during a debate, and to defend the idea that octogenarians can still do their jobs. (If Keith Richards, who just turned 80, can still go out on the road, as the Stones are doing this year, can’t Joe Biden still run a country, with a larger retinue than even Keith’s?)

Harris has proven to be a liability. Her political instincts simply aren’t sharp. She seemed to me like a good choice in 2020—a history-making choice and a choice that showed that Biden was able to turn the other cheek, given the way she schooled him over busing at that early debate. But almost no one I talk to thinks she’s been an asset.

Most people don’t vote on vice presidents, and that will be true this November as well. But she matters a little more than most veeps do, simply because of Biden’s age. Trump will be blunt about all this and make Harris’s possible ascension to the presidency an issue. And much like swapping out the top of the ticket, there is no way of replacing her: The turmoil this will bring with future presidential aspirants jockeying for a promotion, truces between center and left factions of the party coming undone, and a national media that’s perpetually hungering to touch off the next “Democrats in disarray” cycle will spark the real chaos that Trump is hoping to conjure. If there ever was a time for her to up her game, energize Black voters and women voters around abortion rights and other issues, and put her vaunted prosecutorial instincts to work campaigning against the economic enemies of the American people, it is now. And if party leaders work behind the scenes to distance Biden from her or leak stories about how Biden doesn’t want to campaign with her, it will only make things worse.

No, the only thing to do with Harris now is to lean into her hard and try to create a new narrative, a new reality about her. But this is something the Democrats have to do more broadly.

3. What the Democrats Need to Do

Politics is defined by eras. I came of age in the Reagan era. Ronald Reagan was first elected president 44 years ago, before most Americans alive today were even born. In most ways, we are no longer in the Reagan era. But in one crucial way, we still are.

That way is this: When it comes to the terms of our political debate, Republicans are usually on the offensive, while Democrats are more often playing defense. This wasn’t true when I was little and Republicans were the clear minority party. But once the conservative movement swallowed the GOP, during Reagan’s time, it became emphatically true. Republicans relentlessly attacked the liberal status quo, and Democrats defended it, usually meekly. Often, that status quo was hard to defend: High rates of crime, for example, far higher than today’s numbers, were an easy mark for Republicans. On other matters, Democrats played defense by adopting more centrist positions: Oh, we don’t want big government either; just enough government.

Some of those centrist positions were more defensible than others, given the times (liberal sentiment was at a real low point then). I’m not here to debate those again. I am simply explaining a historic dynamic that is to a surprising degree still with us today. Republicans attack government and liberalism, and Democrats typically try to run from directly defending either. Think about it: When was the last time you heard a leading Democratic politician give a major speech defending government—not a particular program like Social Security but just the philosophical idea of a robust public sector? Or calling him or herself a “liberal”? And by the way—is that really still a curse word? You know who the last president to call himself a liberal was? Barack Obama? Not that I remember. No, you need to go back a little further than that. It was John Kennedy, while speaking to the New York Liberal Party (a small party permitted under New York law) as a candidate in 1960. I’m not sure he ever used the word as president.

I don’t particularly care whether Joe Biden calls himself a liberal. But I am saying that the Democrats can’t be supine in 2024. They need to play offense; wake up each day as the party on the attack. They need to head into this campaign proclaiming themselves to be on the side of middle America, because on most questions, they are: on guns, on abortion rights, on an economics built around the middle class and not the rich, on confronting excess corporate power, and many other issues—matters on which the Republican Party is steadfastly stuck on the wrong side.

And here’s another thing they need to do: name their enemies. Not just their political ones but their corporate ones as well. It’s a fact: People know you by the enemies you keep. Explicitly naming enemies hits people emotionally. If an Alabama fan walks into a bar of fellow Tide backers and says, “I love Bama,” everyone will nod and think that’s nice. If he says, “I despise Auburn more than I hate William T. Sherman,” they’ll buy him rounds till closing time. That’s how we’re wired.

Recently, Biden has been talking about price-gouging. Great: It’s high time he spoke about this. (By the way, did you even know this? If not, that points to yet another problem—that congressional Democrats don’t follow the Biden White House’s talking points, and just freelance around with little thought to message discipline.) Biden has even called out Big Pharma, which is progress, because most high-level Democrats have been afraid to do that for years. But he still seems hesitant to go after specific companies by name. A December 13 White House fact sheet on Pharma and price-gouging doesn’t call out a single company by name for ripping off consumers. News articles like this one don’t name any specific companies that Biden has mentioned, which suggests to me that he has not done it.

Name names. Name bad guys. Go after them and shame them. This is the only way to get people to really pay attention. Democrats and liberals sit around wondering why Biden, despite all the policy successes, isn’t connecting with the working classes? This is a big reason why. Those voters will far more readily know he’s on their side if he’s regularly flaying the people who are picking their pockets. I happen to think the junk fees issue, while no one’s idea of a revolution, is political gold. But the White House has to name specific villains. If Biden managed nothing this year but to end Ticketmaster’s practices, that alone could win him millions of votes from low-information voters. It’s uncomplicated, and it’s the kind of thing everyone sees, like a governor lowering a bridge toll.

Finally, Democrats have to exude confidence and a sense of victory. In addition to calling him dangerous, call Trump weak, old, out of it, lazy, senile, dumb, a loser, a bankruptcy buffoon, a clown, a grifter. Mock him. Mock them all. Mock Mike Johnson. Mock Jim Jordan (that wrestling trial is probably going to court this year, by the way). Today’s Republican Party is frightening—but it’s also an absurdist parody. Don’t ignore that second part.

Play offense, name enemies, emanate victory. The voters who will decide this election, unfortunately, have no firm policy convictions. They’ll vote partly on which side has the smell of a winner. Democrats need to act the part.

4. Despair, or Fight

It practically goes without saying that the Democrats will do none of the things I suggest. That kind of aggression just isn’t how most of them roll. Some of the younger Democrats, happily, have the fight in them. One of the things that’s refreshing about new-guard Democrats like Katie Porter and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is that they did not come of age in that prime Reagan era when Democrats were so often backpedaling and apologizing—they love a bit of political knuckle-dusting, and they train for the fights they pick. But for most leading Democrats and their pollsters and operatives, caution is much more the byword than aggression. Playing offense and exuding victory just aren’t in their collective DNA. And I suspect they don’t name names because they’re either just afraid to be that confrontational or because a good number of those malfeasants are their donors, which is a problem they’d better think about.

Biden and the Democrats will campaign on issues: abortion rights, prescription drug prices, democracy preservation, and, they hope, the economy. And certainly, those, or at least the first three, are winning issues for them. I’ve been urging them to tie these policy positions to the broader theme of personal freedom for more than a year. That they’ve started to dip their toes in those waters gives me some hope. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro is the leader here. Real freedom, he often says, is not just letting the free market do whatever it wants. Real freedom is giving people the tools to fulfill their highest potential. That involves protecting their rights, saving their democracy, and putting forward an economic program that helps them live freer lives.

It would be great if we saw more rhetoric like Shapiro’s on the campaign trail from everyone in the party. That may be enough. God knows, the Republicans, although they do a masterful job at exuding victory, are in fact quite incompetent and so chained down by their ideological insularity and culture-war obsessions that they make mistake after mistake. They haven’t managed so far, for all their fearmongering over trans people, to make that a winning issue. “Open borders” fearmongering might work, but remember, it explicitly did not in 2018, when President Trump spent the weeks before the midterms warning about the Texas-bound caravan. Crime? I know facts don’t matter much these days, but the fact is that the murder rate went way down in 2023, in addition to crime rates in most other major categories. The Republicans’ Biden impeachment will likely explode in their faces. They are about to nominate a man who stands every chance of being a convicted felon by Election Day. Liberals spend a lot of energy worrying that every conservative line of attack will resonate (another Reagan-era reflex). But most of them don’t. The right is much stupider than the left gives it credit for.

And most of all: The economic news could be a lot more positive this year than people have been thinking. In November, Goldman Sachs issued an economic forecast that surely has White House officials just praying that it’s correct. Stable wage growth (3.5 percent) and unemployment (3.6 percent). Inflation down to 2 percent. Overall growth of 2 percent. The Federal Reserve cutting interest rates four times this year. As different and unprecedented as this election will be, some things about it might be normal—namely, that the state of the economy will be the main determinant of the outcome. If Goldman is correct, Trump will have a very hard time selling the argument that Biden’s economy is a disaster.

An absence of economic chaos—low inflation, gas prices back to normal—will go a long way toward undercutting Trump’s main contention. But that won’t stop him. “The country is in chaos” will be his relentless argument. He’ll find it wherever he can. Chaos is always unfolding somewhere. That fact is Trump’s big advantage. The world can always be described as going to hell in a handbasket. The right-wing press will echo Trump’s words like Pravda echoed Lenin, and the mainstream media will first report Trump’s words and then refute them, but by then it will be too late.

So we are in for 11 months of hell. But there is only one choice, facing Joe Biden and all elected Democrats, and facing every one of us: Despair or fight. The fascists want us to despair. They’re counting on it.

Fascism is (obviously) an extreme choice for voters, a choice they make under only two conditions: one, when their country is in genuinely deep crisis; or two, when they feel that the anti-fascists are divided, weak, and not presenting a bold and coherent program that counters the chaos narrative. Today the United States confronts a range of serious problems, as it always does; but it is not in any genuinely deep crisis. It’s not 1932 out there. That leaves the second condition. Over that, the Democrats, who for better or worse are our leaders in this battle, have some control. The great question of 2024 is whether the Democrats understand all this. If they are unified, bold, and aggressive, they will establish the reigning narrative, and they will win. If they are not, they will lose. In which case we might say, “Oh well, gear up for the next election.” Except that there might not be one."

Nor Kamala Harris.

And the candidate will be chosen after a Democrat “free-for-all,” according to a forecast from President Donald Trump.

Trump, far and away the leading Republican candidate for the office, also leads Democrats who say they are in the race, including Biden.

But a report from Breitbart said he’s convinced Biden and Harris already are out of the running, even though Biden has repeatedly said he’s campaigning.

“Trump said that while he does ‘hope’ that Biden hangs on for the nomination from the party of leftists, he ‘can’t believe he’s going to be the nominee,'” the report said.

In an interview with Breitbart, Trump said, “He’s a cheater. He’s a scoundrel. He’s a bad guy. But in his life, he’s always been able to convince people he’s this really nice guy. I laugh when they say, ‘Trump is the evil one, and he’s the nice one.’ That’s the one thing he’s been able to do. All you have to do is look at his credentials. When you compare him today to 15 or 20 years ago, he’s a different kind of a guy. The guy can’t talk. The guy can’t put two sentences together. So I do think this: I cannot believe he’s going to be the nominee. I hope he is. But I can’t believe he’s going to be the nominee.”

Trump, in fact, right now is dominating the presidential race, leading all other GOP candidates for the nomination and even Biden in what could be a rematch of the 2020 race for the White House.

The report said, “Asked who he thinks will replace Biden on the Democrat side atop the ticket, Trump said he does not know, but he does not think Harris will make it either. He said some Democrats would argue that if not Biden, it has to be Harris because of the promise Biden made to Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., to pick a black woman as his running mate — which was essential for Clyburn’s backing in 2020 that helped Biden secure the nomination with a resounding victory in the Democrat primary in South Carolina.

“But Trump said he thinks that Harris’s weaknesses, as evidenced by her failures on major national policy items, will prove too daunting for Democrats and that they will need to drop her as well.”

Trump said he cannot confirm who will be the candidate, but said there will be a “free-for-all” among Democrats.

He said, “There will be a point at which it’s a free-for-all. … I don’t think that Biden will make it to the gate.”

IMPORTANT NOTE TO WND READERS: America – long the freest, most prosperous, powerful, altruistic and Christian nation on earth – is on the brink of destruction. Every decent and aware American adult knows this. The evidence is everywhere.

Democrat politicians today overwhelmingly favor late-term abortion up to the very moment of birth – formerly known as “infanticide.” They encourage children too young to drive or vote to have their breasts and/or sex organs amputated in pursuit of a “gender transition” that is both delusional and impossible, and which leads to staggering rates of depression and suicide. They have not just allowed, but ENGINEERED, a full-scale foreign invasion of America across her southern border.

Their standard bearer, President Joe Biden – a senile, pathologically dishonest and epically corrupt career political hack – is destroying America’s economy, energy sector, military, law enforcement, election integrity, national security, Constitution and overall national wellbeing as rapidly as possible. At the same time, Team Biden demonizes and, increasingly, IMPRISONS critics as “violent extremists,” “domestic terrorists,” “white supremacists” and “insurrectionists.” Indeed, they’re currently engaged in an obviously corrupt multi-front legal war against Biden’s chief political rival, Donald J. Trump, in an attempt to send the 45th president of the United States to prison for the rest of his life.

None of this constitutes “politics” in any conventional or traditional American sense. Rather, it is all darkly spiritual. The greatest nation on earth is in the throes of a full-blown spiritual war between good and evil.

The big question, then, is WHAT CAN BE DONE TO SAVE AMERICA? Fortunately, real answers and uncommon wisdom are showcased in the December issue of WND’s critically acclaimed monthly Whistleblower magazine, “CAN AMERICA BE SAVED? The world’s freest, most Christian nation is on the brink of destruction.”

In this very special issue, readers will experience the best and deepest thoughts and strategies on how to restore America to her former goodness and greatness, from some of the nation’s most respected analysts – everyone from Tucker Carlson to Dennis Prager to Victor Davis Hanson to Newt Gingrich and many more.

By James Piereson

Real Clear Wire

President Biden’s sliding poll numbers have set off alarm signals among Democrats who are beginning to see that he might lose the 2024 election to Donald Trump. Those polls have also gotten the attention of pundits who have confidently said for three years now that Trump could never again win a national election. The polling results published over the past few months suggest otherwise: Trump is currently the favorite to win next year’s election.

The most recent RealClearPolitics Average has Trump leading Biden by 2.6 percentage points, a switch of about four points since late summer when Biden led 45%-43%, and in a long-running decline of seven points for Biden since he won the 2020 election with 51% percent of the popular vote.

More ominously for Biden, a recent Bloomberg poll showed Trump well ahead (by an average of five points) in the seven swing states of Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. It appears the most significant factor in recent months is a surge in support for Trump (from 43% to just above 47%), while Biden has essentially remained stuck in neutral.

Joe Biden is an unpopular president, almost as unpopular as any president in the post-war era. According to the RCP Average, just 40% of voters approve of his handling of the job. His ratings have been falling for more than two years since the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. Not coincidentally, voters also take a dim view of where the country is heading, with 68% percent saying it is headed in the wrong direction and just 25% in the right direction.

The president’s ratings have gotten steadily worse over the course of this year. More than 60% of voters say Biden “has moved too far to the left” on policies important to them. Voters are also pessimistic about the economy: 47% say things are getting worse while just 22% say they are getting better, according to a recent Economist/YouGov poll. These are alarming numbers for an incumbent seeking reelection.

Biden is also underwater on nearly every major issue. According to an early December Wall Street Journal poll, Trump is favored over Biden on the three issues voters say are most important to them: the economy (52%-35%), inflation (51%-30%), and securing the border (54%-24%). Voters also favor Trump over Biden on crime, the Russia/Ukraine war, and even the war between Israel and Hamas. These latter two ratings, on Ukraine and Israel, undoubtedly surprised Biden and his supporters, who assumed that voters would endorse his policies in regard to these conflicts. By contrast, voters favor Biden on just two issues: abortion (44%-33%) and Social Security/Medicare (44%-38%).

Voters in these surveys also question Biden’s fitness to hold office, especially as they look ahead to the prospect of another four-year term. According to a new Harris/Harvard poll, 62% of voters doubt that he is fit to carry out the duties of the presidency, and another 48% think his presidency is getting worse year by year and month by month. Whatever their views on the issues, voters appear to think that Biden is increasingly incapable of addressing them.

Biden is losing support among Hispanics voters, a key constituent group of the Democratic Party. Hispanics have been trending away from Democrats and toward Trump over recent election cycles. Hillary Clinton carried Hispanic voters by 37 points in 2016, but Biden carried them by just 21 points in the 2020 election and lags well behind that margin this year. According to recent polls conducted by Economist/YouGov, Biden led Trump among Hispanic voters by 18 points in August, by eight points in September, by four in October, and by just two points (41%-39%) in December. These voters express strong disapproval of Biden’s performance in office, and even disapprove (51%-33 %) of his policies on immigration. Since Hispanics represent about 15% of all U.S. voters, their move away from Biden and toward Trump accounts in part for Biden’s recent slide in the polls.

Another key constituency turning away from the incumbent president is independent voters. Biden carried independents by nine points in 2020. They were a crucial part of his coalition in the swing states he carried narrowly last time, and an important ingredient in his popular vote majority since independents represent one-third of all voters. As with Hispanic voters, he lags far behind that margin in this year’s surveys. A recent Economist/YouGov poll taken in December gave Trump a six-point margin over Biden (38%-32%), with many of those voters still undecided. Still, this represents a 20-point slide for Biden among independents since the 2020 election.

Biden also faces an “enthusiasm gap” among some previously loyal groups who turned out to support him in 2020 due to their dislike for Donald Trump but are disappointed thus far with his performance in office. This is true, in particular, with young voters and, surprisingly, with African American voters as well.

Some suspect that voters under age 30 who are abandoning the president are disillusioned by his support for Israel in its war with Hamas, his failure to cancel student loans, and an insufficiently aggressive posture in regard to climate change. Biden won those voters in 2020 by a margin of 60% to 36%, but due mostly to their dislike for Donald Trump. Much of that antipathy remains. Recent polls continue to give Biden a lead over Trump among these voters: A Yahoo poll in December gave Biden a 55%-27% lead over Trump, while a more recent Emerson College poll reported a smaller margin: 45%-40%. At the same time, just 35% of those voters approve of his performance in office, according to a poll by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University, a measure of their lack of enthusiasm for his reelection campaign.

To the extent young voters disagree with Biden, they do so for progressive reasons – and are unlikely to vote for Trump. But they could stay home, which would be a blow to the Democrats. According to the same poll, fewer than 50% of young voters say they will “definitely” turn out to vote next year, compared to 57% at this point in the 2020 election cycle. In addition, roughly 10% of these voters say they would vote for Robert Kennedy in a multi-candidate race, which further narrows Biden’s lead over Trump in this group.

Biden seems to be in unlikely trouble among black voters. They are by far the most loyal of all Democratic Party voting groups: Biden carried these voters overwhelmingly in 2020 (92%-8%), which also helped him in the swing states. Trump may never win a significant share of this vote, but a doubling of his 2020 total now seems within the realm of possibility. A recent Economist/YouGov poll has Trump with support from 12% of these voters, with many still on the fence.

Perhaps more ominously for Democrats, a growing share of blacks say they will not vote in a contest between Biden and Trump. In a series of Economist/YouGov polls, the percentage of black adults saying they would not vote at all increased from 7% in August to 11% in December. This, despite Biden going a considerable distance to appeal to those voters by appointing African Americans to prominent positions in his administration and taking their side in controversies over civil rights, crime, and government spending. Biden’s challenge among the black community, then, as with young voters, is in regard to enthusiasm and turnout, and not so much with the direct match-up with Trump.

Biden’s strategy for the 2024 campaign becomes clearer in view of his sagging poll numbers. Instead of running on his record, which will be difficult to do in view of his overall ratings, he will emphasize Trump’s defects and the dangers a Trump presidency will pose to the constitutional order.

“We may have problems,” his allies are already saying, “but the other guy is far worse.” The various legal prosecutions underway will be woven into this strategy as a means of appealing to independents and those “on the fence.”

A conviction of Trump in a court of law would aid immensely in this strategy. In addition, Democrats will redouble their efforts to mobilize minority voters and young voters, while sharpening their appeal to Hispanics. Democrats will also ride the abortion issue, which worked for them in 2022, and is one of the few issues that cuts in their favor. Democrats understand that a victory for Trump in the presidential race will also mean that Republicans will take control of the Senate while expanding their margins in the House of Representatives – and thereby enable Trump to carry out his threatening agenda.

Trump, on the other hand, if he can side-step the legal challenges, has his own cards to play in the campaign. For one thing, voters know him, and there is nothing new that Democrats can say about him that they have not already said, ad nauseam, for several years.

Voters can also compare the Trump and Biden presidencies – and Biden does not come off well in that comparison. According to a Wall Street Journal poll taken last month, 50% of voters say Trump’s policies helped them, while just 23% said the same about Biden’s policies; indeed, 53% of voters said that Biden’s policies had hurt them in some way. This allows Trump to ask the question Ronald Reagan posed to voters in 1980 during his campaign against Jimmy Carter: “Are you better off today than you were four years ago?” Many voters will say “no.”

More importantly, Trump does not have to win the popular vote in order to win the election in the Electoral College. The election will be decided in a series of separate races in seven or eight swing states where Trump may have an advantage. If he wins even half of them he is likely to win the election. The national popular vote, measured by these polls, will be somewhat beside the point in determining the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.

Democrats will register large margins of 7 or 8 million votes in the populous states of California, New York, and Illinois, as they did in 2016 and 2020, while Republicans will carry their own large states (Texas and Florida) by less than one million votes – giving Democrats a substantial edge in the popular vote that will not translate directly into electoral votes. Any vote beyond 50% in a state is of no use in the Electoral College – and Democrats tend to “waste” more votes than Republicans.

Trump lost the popular vote to Clinton in 2016 by two percentage points, but still won a safe majority in the Electoral College by carrying nearly every swing state. Biden won the popular vote in 2020 by more than four points (51.3%-46.8%), but carried the critical swing states by narrow margins, in the cases of Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin, by less than one percentage point. A swing of less than 1% from Biden to Trump in those three states would have given Trump a tie in the Electoral College, so that the election would have been decided in the House of Representatives. In addition, reapportionment following the last census will allocate three additional electoral votes to the states Trump won in 2020 – two more to Texas and one to Florida – and three fewer to the states Biden won. This will make Trump’s path to 270 electoral votes slightly easier to navigate. (Pollsters would do well next year to survey the swing states and mostly ignore the national vote.)

It appears, then, that Biden must win the popular vote by at least three points, and perhaps by as many as four, in view of what happened last time in Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin, to be assured of winning a majority in the Electoral College. Current polls have Biden running two points behind Trump in the popular vote, but at the same time show that he is behind by at least five points in the swing states. These polls, along with results of past elections, suggest that there is a gap of at least three points (and maybe four) between the national popular vote and the outcomes in those swing states.

Some have said that Trump has a ceiling of 46% or 47% of the popular vote, and has no chance of reaching 50%, which they say he will need to win the election. This is not so: Trump can win the election with 47% percent of the popular vote if he can keep Biden below 50%, perhaps with the assistance of third-party or independent candidates. If Trump stays close to Biden in the popular vote, which current polls suggest he can do, then he is likely to win the game in the Electoral College.

Trump is fully aware of this (many are not), and will campaign accordingly. He is also aware that Biden will not be able to campaign from his home as he did in 2020, lest voters conclude that he is not up to the job; but the attempt to run a vigorous campaign may further expose that weakness. Nor can he allow his vice president to lead the campaign because she is more unpopular and prone to gaffes than he is.

Trump’s rise in the polls sets the stage for an unusual campaign ahead. Democrats may conclude, in view of Biden’s weakness across the board, that a traditional campaign focusing on issues and turnout may not succeed this time around – and that their hopes will rest upon winning the legal campaign against Trump.

This may explain recent moves by the special prosecutor to expedite the case against Trump in order to win a verdict prior to the election. The reversal of fortunes between Biden and Trump also accounts for the revival of charges that Trump, if elected, will prove to be a “dictator,” and so should be disqualified from the ballot. Those cases, and perhaps the election itself, will be decided this year by the Supreme Court.

For these reasons, and others likely to develop, this is bound to be an ugly and unsettling campaign – and one in which the traditional rules of national politics will be cast to the winds.
