Republican Whatley in 2026,20250728T204500Z,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/journalnow.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/5d/85d2cb5c-dca5-4758-a670-6494ddcb05a7/6887b9e64e046.preview.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124,journalnow.com,English,United States,"Two-term North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper announced Monday his candidacy for the U.S. Senate, establishing his bid for what may be the highest-profile race of the 35 seats up for grabs in 2026.

If Michael Whatley, the national Republican Party chairman and former N.C. party chairman, declares his candidacy, their 15-month race could approach — if not exceed — the rancor of the infamous 1984 race in which Republican incumbent Jesse Helms defeated two-term Democratic Gov. Jim Hunt.

Whatley already has received the pivotal endorsement of President Donald Trump. The president's backing was vital to U.S. Sen. Ted Budd, R-NC, when he emerged from a crowded GOP primary in 2022 that included former Republican Gov. Pat McCrory.

Since Cooper's second term as governor ended on Dec. 31, there has been great speculation of a run for the U.S. Senate. That speculation was fueled after the Democrat removed his name for consideration as a vice-presidential candidate for former Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris in her 2024 presidential run.

However, Cooper said in his first U.S. Senate campaign video, ""I never really wanted to go to Washington.""

""I just wanted to serve the people of North Carolina right here where I've lived my whole life.""

Cooper: These are not ordinary times

In the video, Cooper stressed these are not ordinary times.

""Politicians in D.C. are running up our debt, ripping away our health care and disrespecting our veterans, cutting help for the poor and even putting Medicare and Social Security at risk — just to give tax breaks to billionaires,"" he said.

""That's wrong, and I've had enough. I thought on it and prayed about it, and I want to serve as your next U.S. senator because even now, I still believe our best days are ahead of us.""

Cooper said a key element of his campaign will be appealing to middle-class voters whose desire for a more affordable lifestyle led some to be attracted to Republican's economic appeals in recent elections.

Cooper reminded voters of his own middle-class background and his efforts to serve the middle class as a legislator, attorney general and governor.

""The biggest corporations and the richest Americans have grabbed unimaginable wealth at your expense,"" Cooper said. ""It's time for that to change.""

Cooper touted his efforts to work with Republicans on higher public school teacher pay, major economic-development projects and his signature accomplishment — expanding Medicaid to more than 660,000 North Carolinians since December 2023.

About 200,000 N.C. Medicaid beneficiaries are estimated to be affected if the state institutes work requirements as a condition for participating in Medicaid expansion per the passage of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" in Congress.

""But right now, our country is facing a moment as fragile as any I can remember,"" Cooper said. ""The decisions we make in the next election will determine if we even have a middle class in America anymore.""

Candidate claims

U.S. and state Republicans wasted little time trying to brand Cooper as a ""radical"" candidate.

""Roy Cooper can run, but he can’t hide from his 40-year radical record,"" said Jason Simmons, N.C. Republican Party chairman. ""From raising taxes, closing schools, pardoning violent criminals, and failing during hurricane recovery, he has consistently sided with left-wing interests over families and small businesses. He will do everything he can to work against President Trump in the U.S. Senate.""

“Roy Cooper spent decades dragging North Carolina left and now he wants to do the same to America,” U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., wrote in a X posting.

Meanwhile, former Democratic U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel, who had announced plans to run for the Democratic U.S. Senate nomination, calls Whatley ""a handpicked hardline loyalist known for pushing his extreme agenda as RNC chair.""

""Reminder: Whatley has never questioned Trump, not once. If elected, he wouldn’t represent North Carolina. He’d be a rubber stamp for Trump’s every whim,"" Nickel said.

In February 2021, Whatley led the N.C. Republican Party efforts to unanimously approve a resolution to censure U.S. Sen. Richard Burr over his vote to convict Trump during his second impeachment trial after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.

Burr, who had been in Congress for 26 years, including the last 16 as a senator, is one of several Republicans to be censured by state and county parties for voting for Trump's impeachment.

Will NC flip its US Senate seat?

Republicans hold a 53-47 edge in the U.S. Senate.

Since U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., announced on June 29 he would not seek a third term, most of the major national polling groups have not released a poll for North Carolina's 2026 Senate race.

David McLennan, a political science professor at Meredith College and director of the Meredith Poll, said Sunday its first poll on a potential Cooper-Whatley race should be released in September.

The Cook Political Report, 270towin.com, Rear Clear Politics and Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball all have North Carolina as one of two or three toss-up races — along with Georgia and Michigan — out of the 35 up for election.

The pollsters said that only the 2026 U.S. Senate race in Georgia between Democrat incumbent Jon Ossoff and a potential run by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp could eclipse Cooper and Whatley on the national stage.

Meanwhile, RacetotheWH.com 's first analysis of the race has Cooper with a 71% chance of winning the senate seat and a victory margin of plus-7%, though the state is just rated as ""lean Democratic.""

No primary challengers are listed for either candidate.

""In 2026, Democrats’ best two offensive opportunities are in Maine and North Carolina,"" according to RacetotheWH.com.

""If Democrats can flip two more seats, it would be a successful cycle, and it would give them an excellent shot at taking the Senate in 2028, when the GOP will be defending North Carolina and Wisconsin.""

RacetotheWH.com also lists Georgia and Michigan as leaning Democratic, while Maine and Ohio are its two toss-up states.

Cooper vs. Whatley ahead?

Whatley's announcement is expected soon.

""This virtually guarantees that we will see a general election contest between them in November 2026,"" said John Dinan, a political science professor at Wake Forest University. ""No other Democratic candidate would pose serious competition to Cooper.""

There are media reports, first by Raleigh TV station WRAL, that former U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel will soon end his campaign for the Democratic U.S. Senate nomination in lieu of running for Wake County district attorney.

Cooper's candidacy is a positive development for the Democratic Party's chances of winning an open seat in an off-year election, said John Quinterno, principal with South by North Strategies Ltd., a Chapel Hill research company specializing in economic and social policy.

""Cooper has statewide name recognition from his years in office and a track record of winning statewide races in difficult conditions. He also has an ability to raise money, likely to attract a great deal of attention, funding, and support from allied groups, both state and nationally,"" Quinterno said.

Meanwhile, Whatley is considered as a viable alternative to North Carolina's 10 Republican members of the U.S. House, including Reps. Pat Hannigan and Addison McDowell, both of whom represent the Triad in Congress.

Harrigan announced his run for re-election to the U.S. House almost immediately after Trump’s endorsement of Whatley hit Trump's Truth Social outlet.

""Whatley's entry into the race signals that he has President Trump's blessing since Trump's backing of Whatley would essentially clear the field of meaningful competition on the Republican side given how critical Trump's endorsement is for Republican primaries,"" Dinan said.

Andy Nilsson, a Winston-Salem resident and a Republican campaign official for more than 30 years, filed his statement of candidacy in January with the Federal Elections Commission.

Nilsson had expressed views opposing what he called some of the excesses during the first Trump administration, but now says he supports Trump’s America First agenda.

In three posts on X over the weekend, Nilsson maintained his U.S. Senate Republican candidacy.

A July 27 post by Nilsson read, ""This primary is about who can beat Roy Cooper next November. We need a Jesse Helms conservative, someone who is pro-faith, pro-life, pro-gun, pro-family. I am that conservative.""

Nilsson also had a July 25 meme on X that said, ""I'm not going anywhere.""

Quinterno said that in past election cycles having a candidate such as Whatley, who hasn't held public office, would have been a major obstacle.

""Republican primaries often are more fractious and can produce surprise nominees,"" Quinterno said. ""It also remains unclear if support for Whatley from President Trump will translate to other Republicans or if issues ranging from the Epstein scandal to feelings of betrayal over a failure to achieve many of the issues Trump campaigned on will be attached to Whatley.""

Potential keys

Mitch Kokai, a senior policy analyst with the conservative leaning John Locke Foundation, said Cooper carries considerable momentum in a U.S. Senate campaign given he has won six statewide general elections and has a proven history of attracting votes from Trump supporters.

“For Republicans, it’s likely that few people outside of the activist base know much about Whatley. But the expected Trump endorsement is likely to discourage any other potential candidates,"" Kokai said. ""Everyone involved in North Carolina GOP politics remembers 2022, when a Trump endorsement helped propel Ted Budd to victory over two other contenders with lengthier resumes and higher name recognition.”

Christopher Cooper, a political science professor at Western Carolina University, said a successful GOP primary nominee will almost certainly be to the right of Tillis.

“The MAGA wing of the Republican Party will be represented. The question is whether it will be after the general election, as well,” Christopher Cooper said. ""Research on the power of Trump’s endorsement demonstrates pretty clearly that it has power in a Republican primary but doesn’t help or hurt in a general election."""

All Of The Marvels

by Douglas Wolk

Penguin Workshop

$28.99

The publisher says:

The first-ever full reckoning with Marvel Comics’ interconnected, half-million-page story, a revelatory guide to the “epic of epics”—and to the past sixty years of American culture—from a beloved authority on the subject who read all 27,000+ Marvel superhero comics and lived to tell the tale. The super-hero comic books that Marvel Comics has published since 1961 are, Douglas Wolk notes, the longest continuous, self-contained work of fiction ever created: over half a million pages to date, and growing. The Marvel story is a gigantic mountain, smack in the middle of contemporary culture. Thousands of writers and artists have contributed to it. Every schoolchild recognises its protagonists: Spider-Man, the Avengers, the X-Men. Looking over close to sixty years of Marvel’s comics, Wolk sees fascinating patterns - the rise and fall of particular cultural aspirations, and of the storytelling modes that conveyed them. This is a huge treat for Marvel fans, but it’s also a revelation for readers who don’t know Doctor Strange from Doctor Doom. Here, truly, are all of the marvels. Douglas Wolk is the author of the Eisner Award–winning Reading Comics and the host of the podcast Voice of Latveria. A National Arts Journalism Program fellow, Wolk has written about comic books, graphic novels, pop music and technology for The New York Times, Rolling Stone, The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, The Believer, Slate and Pitchfork. He lives in Portland, Oregon. 384pgs B&W hardcover,



Borders

by Thomas King & Natasha Donovan

Little Brown

$24.99

The publisher says:

From two celebrated Indigenous creators comes a powerful graphic novel about a family caught between nations. Borders is a masterfully told story of a boy and his mother whose road trip from Alberta to Salt Lake City is thwarted at the border when they identify their citizenship as Blackfoot. Refusing to identify as either American or Canadian first bars their entry into the US, and then their return into Canada. In the limbo between countries, they find power in their connection to their identity and to each other. A beautifully told tale with broad appeal, Borders resonates deeply with themes of identity, justice and belonging. Thomas King has written several highly acclaimed children’s books including A Coyote Solstice Tale (illustrated by Gary Clement) which won the American Indian Library Association Youth Literature Award for Best Picture Book and A Coyote Columbus Story (illustrated by Kent Monkman) which was a Governor General’s Award finalist. King, who is of Cherokee and Greek descent and was born in California, was chair of American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota, before moving to University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada. He recently won a Governor General’s Award for his adult novel, The Back of the Turtle; he won both the BC National Award for Canadian Nonfiction and the RBC Taylor Prize for The Inconvenient Indian. Natasha Donovan is a Métis illustrator with a focus on comics and children’s illustration. She has illustrated several award-winning children’s books including The Sockeye Mother by Brett Huson and the graphic novel Surviving the City by Tasha Spillett-Sumner.

Call Me Nathan

by Catherine Castro & Quentin Zuttion

SelfMadeHero

$19.99

The publisher says:

A true coming-of-age story that explores transgender identity. “All I want is a proper body . . . ”Born as biologically female, Nathan spends his formative years facing questions without answers, social ostracism from his peers, and incomprehension from his family-because from as early as he can remember, he knows he has been born in the wrong body. But, as his family comes to recognise, a physical identity is harder to change than a piece of clothing or a haircut. So from the moment he is at last supplied with a professional term for his self-diagnosis-“gender dysphoria”-he is able to leave behind his complicated psychological history, the challenges of his self-harming and his struggles with sexual identity, and begin the difficult process of claiming his true self. Based on a true story, at first hand, Call Me Nathan issues a moving call for understanding, a powerful denunciation of prejudice and a celebration of everything it means to love. Catherine Castro is a reporter for Marie Claire. The author of several books, her investigations have led her to explore gender issues around the world. Quentin Zuttion is a widely published illustrator and artist who cites Brecht Evens, Julie Maroh and Egon Schiele among the influences on the airily physical style of his work. 144pgs colour paperback.



Ciguatera Vol. 1

by Minoru Furuta

Vertical

$24.95

The publisher says:

A story of self-doubting youth from award-winning manga creator Minoru Furuya, in his English debut series, Ciguatera. This coming-of-age tale from contemporary master Minoru Furuya centres on seventeen-year-old Yusuke Ogino, a self-described loser whose only refuge from the bullying hell he experiences at school is his dream of freedom on a motorcycle. But the unexpected entrance of a beautiful young woman into his life threatens to upend his whole world, forcing him to re-evaluate his relationships and even his sense of self. Instantly relatable and painfully honest, Furuya’s manga blends pitch-black humour with pathos and the awkward realities of everyday life to produce a quintessential tale of youth. The meticulous yet uninhibited art swings from stark realism to laugh-out-loud caricature, while nuanced characters and complex emotions help Ciguatera transcend the bounds of genre to take its rightful place as one of the great masterpieces of graphic storytelling. Born in 1972 in Saitama Prefecture, Minoru Furuya trained to be a barber before trying his hand at manga. His prize-winning debut The Ping Pong Club was made into a hit anime, while his series Himeanole and Himizu have both been adapted for film, the latter winning the Marcello Mastroianni Award when it screened in competition at the Venice International Film Festival. Furuya’s fans include Oscar-winning director Bong Joon-ho (Parasite), manga artist Inio Asano (Girl on the Shore) and video game visionary Hideo Kojima (Metal Gear). Ciguatera was serialised in Young Magazine, 2003-5, and published by Kodansha in 6 volumes. 452pgs B&W paperback.



Discipline

by Dash Shaw

New York Review Comics

$29.95

The publisher says:

A teenage Quaker joins the Union Army and experiences firsthand the brutality of the Civil War in this singular graphic novel by a beloved comics artist and animator. During the Civil War, many Quakers were caught between their fervent support of abolition, a desire to preserve the Union, and their long-standing commitment to pacifism. When Charles Cox, a young Quaker from Indiana, slips out early one morning to enlist in the Union Army, he scandalises his family and his community. Leaving behind the strict ways of Quaker life, Cox is soon confronted with the savagery of battle, the cruelty of the enemy (as well as of his fellow soldiers), and the overwhelming strangeness of the world beyond his home. He clings to his faith and family through letters with his sister, Fanny, who faces her own trials at home: betrayal, death, and a church that seems ready to fracture under the stress of the war. Discipline is told largely through the letters exchanged between the Cox siblings—incorporating material from actual Quaker and soldier journals of the era—and drawn in a style that combines modern graphic storytelling with the Civil War–era battlefield illustrations of the likes of Thomas Nast and Winslow Homer. The result is a powerful consideration of faith, justice, and violence, and an American comics masterpiece. Dash Shaw was raised Quaker in Richmond, Virginia, where he currently lives. He is the cartoonist of many graphic novels and wrote and directed two animated feature films, the most recent of which, Cryptozoo, won the 2021 Sundance Film Festival’s NEXT Innovator Prize and will be distributed by Magnolia Pictures. Shaw began working on Discipline in 2014, and it was drawn over the course of six years. 312pgs B&W paperback.



Dromedaries

by Marta Frej

Centrala

$17.00 / £12.00

The publisher says:

An important role was played in the armed struggle against the Russian authorities by women who were active within the Polish Socialist Party’s paramilitary units. In underground jargon they were known as ‘Dromaderki’, the feminine form of the Polish word for dromedaries—the one-humped Arabian camels used to transport people and goods—because they carried weapons, ammunition and explosive materials. In the Częstochowa district alone there were several dozen of them. Unfortunately, most of them have remained anonymous; the names or aliases of only a few of them have survived to the present day. In “civilian” life they were students, teachers, doctors, housewives or factory workers. Active involvement in the fight for independence meant the risk of imprisonment, lengthy sentences to hard labour, or exile to Siberia. Marta Frej is a painter, illustrator, and, through her role as chair of the „Kulturoholizm” foundation, an organizer of cultural events. She is well known for her feminist online memes, which combine sparkling, pointed wit and finely crafted graphics. Marta Frej was born in Częstochowa in 1973. She is a graduate of the Łódź Academy of Fine Arts. Her creative work dedicated to the defence of gender equality and women’s rights won her the 2015 Okulary Równości („Spectacles of Equality”) prize, awarded by the Izabela Jaruga-Nowacka Foundation. She also won the 2017 O!Lśnienia roku („Revelation of the Year”) award in the art category. Her most popular works are her captioned pictures illustrating modern women’s life in Poland, which have been exhibited in various galleries throughout the country. Dromedaries is her first solo publication in book form. 36pgs colour hardcover.

With a group of adventurers and resistance fighters, he parachutes into Germany to do just that. (3) Cuba, late 1950s. Our literary lion is in his twilight years, writing his memoirs, remembering his first and second meeting with the seemingly immortal Athos.

Invisible Presence: The Representation of Women in French-Language Comics

by Catriona MacLeod

Intellect Books

£85.00

The publisher says:

This book looks at the representation of female characters in French comics from their first appearance in 1905. Organised into three sections, the book looks at the representation of women as main characters created by men, as secondary characters created by men, and as characters created by women. It focuses on female characters, both primary and secondary, in the francophone comic or bande dessinée, as well as the work of female bande dessinée creators more generally. Until now these characters and creators have received relatively little scholarly attention; this new book is set to change this status quo. Using feminist scholarship, especially from well-known film and literary theorists, the book asks what it means to draw women from within a phallocentric, male-dominated paradigm, as well as how the particular medium of bande dessinée, its form as well as its history, has shaped dominant representations of women. This is the first book to study the representation of women in the French-language drawn strip. There are no other works with this specific focus, either on women in Franco-Belgian comics, or on the drawn representation of women by men. This is a very useful addition to both general discussions of French-language comics, and to discussions of women’s comics, which are focused on comics by women only. As it is written in English, and due to the popularity of comic art in Britain and the United States, this book will primarily appeal to an Anglo-American market. However, the cultural and gender studies approach this text employs (theoretical frameworks still not widely seen in non-Anglophone studies of the bande dessinée) will ensure that the text is also of interest to a Franco-Belgian audience. This book will appeal both to an academic and to a more general readership with an interest in popular comic art. It will be useful to academics, researchers and students (undergraduates and postgraduates) in comic art, art history, contemporary art, French studies, gender studies, feminist studies and media studies. Excellent potential for inclusion on reading lists. With a focus on an art-form which also inspires a lot of public (non-academic) enthusiasm, it will also appeal to fans of the bande dessinée (or wider comic art medium) who are interested in the representation of women in comic art, and to comics scholars on a broad scale. Catriona MacLeod is a lecturer in French Studies and Politics at the University of London Institute in Paris (ULIP). Her research interests concern women in French-language graphic novels (bandes dessinées) and narratives of trauma and migration in bandes dessinées and caricatures. 256pgs B&W with 16 plates, 7 colour, 9 B&W, hardcover.



Leonard Cohen On A Wire

by Philippe Girard

Drawn & Quarterly

$24.95

The publisher says:

A captivating, revealing biography of the legendary musician and poet. Leonard Cohen opens in Los Angeles on the last night of the man’s life in 2016. Alone in his final hours, the beloved writer and musician ponders his existence in a series of flashbacks that reveal the ups and downs of a storied career. A young Cohen traded in the promise of steady employment in his family’s Montreal garment business for the unlikely path of a literary poet. His life took another sharp turn when, already in his thirties, he recorded his first album to widespread international acclaim. Along the way he encountered a who’s who of musical luminaries, including Lou Reed, Nico, Janis Joplin and Joni Mitchell. And then there’s Phil Spector, the notorious music impresario who held a gun to Cohen’s head during a coke-fuelled, all-night recording session. Later in Cohen’s life, there’s the story of “Hallelujah,” one of his most famous songs, and its slow rise from relative obscurity when first recorded in the 1980s to its iconic status a decade later with covers by John Cale and Jeff Buckley. And the period when Cohen went broke after his manager embezzled his lifetime savings, which ironically sparked an unlikely career resurgence and several worldwide tours in the 2000s. Written with careful attention to detail and drawn with a palette of warm, lush colours by the Quebec-based cartoonist Philippe Girard, Leonard Cohen is an engaging portrait of a cultural icon. Philippe Girard was born in Québec City, Canada, in 1971. He published his first comic in a children’s magazine when he was eight years old and has since published more than twenty books. His comics have received the Joe Shuster, the Bedelys Quebec and the Bedeis Causa Awards. 120pgs colour hardcover.

Lugosi: Rise & Fall of Hollywood’s Dracula

by Koren Shadmi

Humanoids / Life Drawn

$24.99

The publisher says:

A biography chronicling the tumultuous personal and professional life of horror icon Bela Lugosi. As horror cinema’s most iconic actor, Lugosi is forever remembered for his haunting role as Count Dracula, frightening filmgoers for many years. But once the cameras finally stopped rolling…that’s when Lugosi himself learned what true terror was. Lugosi, the tragic life story of one of horror’s most iconic film stars, tells of a young Hungarian actor and activist forced to flee his homeland after the failed Communist revolution in 1919. This first-of-its-kind graphic memoir details Lugosi’s flight after becoming an enemy of the state and his eventual move to the US, where his career flourished-for a while. Reinventing himself, first on stage and then in movies, he landed the unforgettable role of Count Dracula in what would become a series of classic feature films. From that point forward, Lugosi’s stardom would be assured…but with international fame came setbacks and addictions that gradually whittled his reputation from icon to has-been. Following a pivotal career mistake that allowed Boris Karloff’s star to rise while his plummeted, Lugosi’s pride, extravagant lifestyle, and addiction to drugs, women, and the high life led to his tragic decline and humiliating later years that saw him join forces with infamous B-movie director Ed Wood for one last shot at stardom. Lugosi details the actor’s fall from grace and an enduring legacy that continues to this day. Koren Shadmi is an American-Israeli, Brooklyn based graphic novelist and illustrator. His books have been published internationally and include: In The Flesh, The Abaddon, Mike’s Place and most recently The Twilight Man: Rod Serling and the Birth of Television.

Memories from the Civil War Vol. 1

by Richard Marazano & Jean-Michel Ponzio

Cinebook

$13.95

The publisher says:

In a not-so-distant future, mankind’s greed and short-sightedness have exhausted the planet. The vast majority of the population lives in misery among the ruins of civilisation, while a small, privileged minority continues to enjoy a luxurious existence inside a few fortress-cities scattered around the globe, the Enclaves. Vivian is a member of the elite forces that protect this utopia - but also regularly hunt down and capture people from outside the walls to use as cheap, forced labour. Richard Marazano is a jack of all trades – art, politics, physics, astrophysics, classical studies – who also does comics. He’s worked on over 30 series and one-shots, including SAM and The Chimpanzee Complex, both translated by Cinebook. Jean-Michel Ponzio made several 3D short films, and also worked for cinema and advertising. He worked with Marazano on series Genetiks and The Chimpanzee Complex. 56pgs colour paperback.



MonsterMind

by Alfonso Casas

Ablaze

$19.99

The publisher says:

Alfonso Casas’s MonsterMind is a very personal account of the inner monsters that live inside his head. But who doesn’t have a monster inside them? Who has never heard that voice inside their head undermining everything they do? You’re not good enough…You just got really lucky…There are people far better and more qualified than you… In a very honest exercise, Alfonso Casas identifies and introduces his own monsters to his readers: Mr. Past Traumas, Mr. Fear, Mr. Social Anxiety, Mr. Impostor Syndrome, Mr. Sadness, Mr. Doubt…the pessimistic, the insecure, the self-demanding, the monster that keeps you from sleeping while you think of what you could have said back in that conversation two years ago, or that keeps you looking over the punctuation of every text message to figure out the tone lurking beneath the surface. All those monsters make up the bestiary of contemporary society. But the anxiety generation is expert in more things: in looking inside themselves and their lives, and — why not? — in laughing at their own neuroses as best they can. In the end, if the monsters won’t leave us, we might as well get to know them and laugh at them! Anxiety is another pandemic, but the monsters dwelling inside us are funny, too (especially as drawn by Alfonso Casas). Includes a discussion guide to help readers further discuss anxiety and find ways to deal with it. 144pgs colour hardcover.



Nod Away Vol. 2

by Joshua W. Cotter

Fantagraphics

$24.99

The publisher says:

An SF graphic novel, the second in an epic series, set in a near-future where the internet is telepathic and its hub is a human child. Vol. 2 moves away from the deep space transport where Vol. 1 took place and moves to earthly terrain, peeling back layers of Cotter’s world-building to reveal the bigger picture of this graphic novel series in ways that upend expectations. Aveline Moiré is a headstrong but self-destructive young French woman. When she meets and moves in with a young artist, Walter Walker, little do they know that the wheels they set in motion may bring about the end of humankind. Working within the structure of SF, Nod Away explores what consciousness could be, its location, what function or point it might serve, and how a lack of personal responsibility and accountability will always corrupt it. At a projected seven volumes and over 2000 pages in all, Nod Away is poised to be one of the great comics classics of the 21st century. Joshua W. Cotter’s debut graphic novel, Skyscrapers of the Midwest, was nominated for an Ignatz award in 2005. He lives in rural northwest Missouri with his family and cats with an acute sense of impending mortality. They keep him making comics. 360pgs B&W paperback.

On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century

by Timothy Snyder, illustrated by Nora Krug

Ten Speed Press

$22.99 / $16.99

The publisher says:

A graphic edition of historian Timothy Snyder’s bestselling book of lessons for surviving and resisting America’s arc toward authoritarianism, featuring the visual storytelling talents of renowned illustrator Nora Krug. Timothy Snyder’s New York Times bestseller On Tyranny uses the darkest moments in twentieth-century history, from Nazism to Communism, to teach twenty lessons on resisting modern-day authoritarianism. Among the twenty include a warning to be aware of how symbols used today could affect tomorrow (“4: Take responsibility for the face of the world”), an urgent reminder to research everything for yourself and to the fullest extent (“11: Investigate”), a point to use personalised and individualised speech rather than clichéed phrases for the sake of mass appeal (“9: Be kind to our language”), and more. In this graphic edition, Nora Krug draws from her highly inventive art style in Belonging — at once a graphic memoir, collage-style scrapbook, historical narrative and trove of memories — to breathe new life, colour and power into Snyder’s riveting historical references, turning a quick-read pocket guide of lessons into a visually striking rumination. In a time of great uncertainty and instability, this edition of On Tyranny emphasises the importance of being active, conscious and deliberate participants in resistance. Timothy Snyder is the Housum Professor of History at Yale University and a member of the Committee on Conscience of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. He is the author of the bestselling books Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin and Black Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warning. His work has received the literature award of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Hannah Arendt Prize and the Leipzig Book Prize for European Understanding. Snyder is a frequent contributor to The New York Review of Books and the Times Literary Supplement and a former contributing editor at The New Republic.

In Other Boys, debut author Damian Alexander delivers a moving middle-grade graphic memoir about his struggles with bullying, the death of his mother and coming out. Damian is the new kid at school, and he has a foolproof plan to avoid the bullying that’s plagued him his whole childhood: he’s going to stop talking. Starting on the first day of seventh grade, he won’t utter a word. But his vow of silence doesn’t work — his classmates can tell there’s something different about him. His family doesn’t look like the kind on TV: his mother is dead, his father is gone and he’s being raised by his grandparents in a low-income household. And Damian does things that boys aren’t supposed do, like play with Barbies instead of G.I. Joe. Kids have teased him about this his whole like, especially other boys. But if boys can be so cruel, why does Damian have a crush on one? Damian Alexander is a cartoonist and storyteller who grew up in and around Boston. His first graphic novel, Other Boys, is based off his viral and award-winning autobiographical webcomics.

by Priya Huq

Amulet Books

$22.99 / $12.99

The publisher says:

In this middle-grade graphic novel, Nisrin will have to rely on faith, friends, and family to help her recover after she is the target of a hate crime. Nisrin is a 13-year-old Bangladeshi-American girl living in Milwaukie, Oregon, in 2002. As she nears the end of eighth grade, she gives a presentation for World Culture Day about Bangladesh while wearing a traditional cultural dress. On her way home, she is the victim of a hate crime when a man violently attacks her for wearing a headscarf. Deeply traumatised by the experience, Nisrin spends the summer depressed and isolated. Other than weekly therapy, Nisrin doesn’t leave the house until fall arrives and it’s time for her to start freshman year at a new school. The night before class starts, Nisrin makes a decision. She tells her family she’s going to start wearing hijab, much to their dismay. Her mother and grandparent’s shocked and angry reactions confuse her-but they only strengthen her resolve. This choice puts Nisrin on a path to not only discover more about Islam, but also her family’s complicated relationship with the religion, and the reasons they left Bangladesh in the first place. On top of everything else, she’s struggling to fit in at school-her hijab makes her a target for students and faculty alike.

Putin’s Russia: The Rise of a Dictator

by Darryl Cunningham

Myriad Editions

£16.99

Master manipulator or gangster? The malign thrust of Putin’s domestic and foreign policy is exposed in Cunningham’s latest page-turning biography including his early life, political career, the wars in Chechnya, Crimea and the Ukraine, the crackdown on human rights, Brexit, Trump—and the poisonings. Author of more than six acclaimed graphic novels and well-known for his economical drawing and clear, explanatory narrative, Cunningham shows how the West and its leaders have been culpable in aiding Putin’s rise—Obama being a particular example. Areas covered include Brexit and Trump; the crackdown on human rights, especially on homosexuality in Russia; and the poisonings—among them, journalist Anna Politkovskaya in Russia, Alexander Litvinenko in London, Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. By putting all these events into a timeline, Cunningham aims to show that Putin is opportunistic rather than the master manipulator people make him out to be: ‘He’s essentially a gangster and not a particularly smart one. We need to demythologise Putin if we are to beat him.’ 144pgs colour paperback.



Red Lines: Political Cartoons and The Struggle Against Censorship

by Cherian George & Sonny Liew

MIT Press

$34.95

A lively graphic narrative reports on censorship of political cartoons around the world, featuring interviews with censored cartoonists from Pittsburgh to Beijing. Why do the powerful feel so threatened by political cartoons? Cartoons don’t tell secrets or move markets. Yet, as Cherian George and Sonny Liew show us in Red Lines, cartoonists have been harassed, trolled, sued, fired, jailed, attacked and assassinated for their insolence. The robustness of political cartooning—one of the most elemental forms of political speech—says something about the health of democracy. In a lively graphic narrative—illustrated by Liew, himself a prize-winning cartoonist—Red Lines crisscrosses the globe to feel the pulse of a vocation under attack. A Syrian cartoonist insults the president and has his hands broken by goons. An Indian cartoonist stands up to misogyny and receives rape threats. An Israeli artist finds his antiracist works censored by social media algorithms. And the New York Times, caught in the crossfire of the culture wars, decides to stop publishing editorial cartoons completely. Red Lines studies thin-skinned tyrants, the invisible hand of market censorship and demands in the name of social justice to rein in the right to offend. It includes interviews with more than sixty cartoonists and insights from art historians, legal scholars and political scientists—all presented in graphic form. This engaging account makes it clear that cartoon censorship doesn’t just matter to cartoonists and their fans. When the red lines are misapplied, all citizens are potential victims. Cherian George is Professor of Media Studies at Hong Kong Baptist University’s School of Communication. A former journalist, he is the author of Hate Spin: The Manufacture of Religious Offense and Its Threat to Democracy (MIT Press). Sonny Liew is a celebrated cartoonist and illustrator and the author of The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye, a New York Times bestseller, which received three Eisner Awards and the Singapore Literature Prize. 448pgs colour paperback.



Secret Passages 1985…1986

by Axelle Lenoir

IDW / Top Shelf

$19.99

The publisher says:

Welcome to an autobiography from another dimension. A wildly inventive cartoonist begins her imaginary memoir — exploring the girlhood she never had. ‘Ever since my cosmic twin disappeared, nothing makes sense anymore. Friends, work, life-well, you get the picture. For all of five minutes I thought therapy might be the answer. But then I remembered: I’m a cartoonist. Why waste a skilled professional’s time when I could just spend 10 years of my life making an autobiographical comic and call it a “voyage of self-discovery”? So here it is: the opening chapter of my life. It’s 1985 in a small Quebec town called Notre-Dame du Lac. We’re going to get to know a little girl who enjoys chatting with the forest (that’s me!), a younger brother with demonic tendencies, a tyrannical older brother, and two marvellous parents who may or may not be aliens. And please, PLEASE, take my advice, dear reader. If you ever find yourself in the midst of an existential crisis, don’t make a comic about it. See a therapist instead. Much love!’ Axelle Lenoir started out as a 2D artist in 1999, for a Quebec City video game company. In 2003, craving more creative freedom, she quit and made her first steps in comic books. Her Mertownville trilogy was released by the Swiss publisher Paquet in the mid-2000s. Since then, Axelle has worked with publishers in France, Belgium and Canada. Her first English-language graphic novel, Camp Spirit (Top Shelf), is a coming-of-age story about an unlikely friendship between two summer camp counsellors. Her next book, a comic strip collection named What If We Were..., portrays two teenage girls who invented a weird and funny game to fill their spare time. Axelle’s writing style is a mix between humour, everyday life situations, fantasy and comic strips. She likes to write about women, teenagers, folklore, parallel universes and stupid cats. 184pgs one-colour paperback.

The Art of Thai Comics: A Century of Strips and Stripes

by Nicolas Verstappen

River Books Press

$45 / £32.50

The publisher says:

After the first Thai comic strip was published in 1907, comics flourished in Siam and developed in uniquely Thai ways. With diverse and leading artists working in each generation there is a wealth of material to consider. Gory horror tales, anti-communist propaganda and socially-engaged graphic novels bear witness to the country’s darker years. From 1990, Thai comics struggled to compete with the sudden influx of unlicensed Japanese manga and went through a hiatus, making a comeback in the late ‘90s with a new and alternative scene that deserves wider recognition. Each page of The Art of Thai Comics opens a unique window onto Thai society - a distilled vision of its hopes, fears, delights and horrors. From 20th century interpretations of Jataka tales, which replay the Buddha’s various reincarnations, to tales of modern-day millennial angst. Thai comics past and present offer an entertaining and enlightening viewpoint onto the country’s history, culture and enduring creativity. Nicolas Verstappen, a Belgian national, is a full-time lecturer at the Faculty of Communication Arts at Chulalongkrn University in Bangkok where he teaches Comics Art History and Composition. 288pgs colour paperback.



The Jewish Brigade

by Marvano

Dead Reckoning

$24.95

The publisher says:

In the waning years of World War II, a Jewish fighting force, known as the Jewish Infantry Brigade Group, was born as part of the British Eighth Army. Leslie Toliver, a racing car driver in the pre-war years, eagerly joined the all-volunteer force for a chance to fight with his people against those who sought to murder them. When the war in Europe ends and the “savage continent” sits on the brink of continental civil war from chaos, terror and famine, Leslie and the Brigade move to Tarvisio, Italy, a border triangle city perfect for covert action. While out searching for Holocaust survivors, Leslie undertakes vigilante missions in Soviet occupied Eastern Europe hunting down Nazis on the run for both vengeance and justice. With each Nazi found or refugee rescued, he looks for more information to complete his most personal mission: to find his mother and fiancée who went missing in the upheaval of the war. Born in Belgium, Marc Vanoppen, known as Marvano, started out as an interior designer. Years later, he began an alternate career as an illustrator, eventually becoming editor-in-chief of the magazine Kuifje, then managing the comics department of Flemish publisher Den Gulden Engel. All the while he published his own comics and went on to write and illustrate dozens of graphic novels over decades, most notably adapting Joe Halderman’s famous novel The Forever War. 144pgs colour paperback.

The Sisters Dietl

by Vojtěch Mašek

Centrala

$35.00 / £25.00

The publisher says:

A horror detective story about two sisters, whose world is created from the surreal visions of Vojtěch Mašek, one of the most acclaimed Czech comics authors. When one of the Dietl sisters ends up in hospital after what appears to be a brutal attack, leaving her with a mutilated face and unable to move, Mašek leads the reader on a detective story exploring change of identity, doppelgängers, deformation, hallucination and altered states of mind in contrast with idyllic family life. This comics takes place in a fictional world woven from dreams, hazy and distorted memories of childhood fears, fear of the unknown and the desire for a safe hiding place. Reality is constantly disrupted by doubts, changing points of view, the neurotic need to find objective truth. All this is contained in the story about the Dietl sisters – many theories, many possibilities but seemingly with only one solution. Mašek employs a unique multilayered art style, combining backgrounds created from various texts, newspaper cuttings and patterns with the main plot taking place in the foreground. With slight exaggeration it could be said that whatever discipline Vojtěch Mašek (born 1977) turns his hand to, his work always meets with incredible success: he was one of the screenwriters on the film Křižáček (The Little Crusader, 2017), which won best film at the festival in Karlovy Vary, while the children’s book Panáček, pecka, švestka, poleno a zase panáček (Puppet, Plum Pit, Plum, Plank and Back to Puppet, 2018), story by Mašek and art by Chrudoš Valoušek, won the prestigious Bologna Ragazzi Award. However, he is most at home in the world of comics, which he creates either on his own or in partnership with other artists and writers. Since 2002, he and Džian Baban have been developing the surreally farcical world of Monstrkabaret Freda Brunolda (Fred Brunold’s Monster Cabaret), which has appeared in five comic books, more than a dozen stage adaptations and in short films. They have also written two award-winning graphic novels with art by Jiří Grus. He also recently worked with the writer Marek Šindelka on the contemporary graphic novel Svatá Barbora (Saint Barbara, art by Marek Pokorný, 2018), and his list of projects continues to grow. 248pgs colour hardcover.



This Is How I Disappear

by Mirion Malle, translated by Aleshia Jensen & Bronwyn Haslam

Drawn & Quarterly

$24.00

The publisher says:

An affecting glimpse into the ways millennials cope with mental health struggles. Clara’s at a breaking point. She’s got writer’s block, her friends ask a lot without giving much, her psychologist is useless and her demanding publishing job leaves little time for self-care. She seeks solace in the community around her, yet, while her friends provide support and comfort, she is often left feeling empty, unable to express an underlying depression that leaves her immobilised and stifles any attempts at completing her poetry collection. In This Is How I Disappear, Mirion Malle paints an empathetic portrait of a young woman wrestling with psychological stress and the trauma following a sexual assault. Malle displays frankness and a remarkable emotional intelligence as she explores depression, isolation and self-harm in her expertly drawn novel. Her heroine battles an onslaught of painful emotions and while Clara can provide consolation to those around her, she finds it difficult to bestow the same understanding on herself. Only when she allows her community to guide her toward self-love does she find relief. Filled with 21st century idioms and social media communication, This Is How I Disappear opens a window onto the lives of young people as they face a barrage of mental health hurdles. Scenes of sisterhood, fun nights out singing karaoke and impromptu FaceTime therapy sessions show how this generation is coping, connecting and healing together.

Article Summary

U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly, a Matteson Democrat, is running for Illinois’ open U.S. Senate seat, emphasizing accomplishments throughout her career.

It’s the third match-up between Kelly and a candidate backed by Gov. JB Pritzker.

Kelly has more than $2 million in her campaign fund, putting her second in the Democratic primary in fundraising.

Gun violence prevention has been one of her top priorities as a member of Congress and she said she believes Democrats are gaining more support on the issue.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

The Democratic primary for Illinois’ open U.S. Senate seat features three of the state’s most notable Democrats, but U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly isn’t worried big spending or endorsements for her opponents will drown out her voice.

“I’m used to tough races and really I’ve been motored by the people and that’s what it really comes down to,” Kelly told Capitol News Illinois. “I get out there, I grind, I meet everybody I can, and when I am in my position, again, I do the work.”

Kelly was the second Democrat to announce her intentions to replace retiring Sen. Dick Durbin in the 2026 election. She entered the race in early May about two weeks after Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton announced her candidacy that quickly came with endorsements from Gov. JB Pritzker and other Illinois Democrats.

U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi entered the race shortly after Kelly and brought with him more than $21 million in campaign funds to use as of the July fundraising report — nearly 10 times the $2.2 million Kelly has on hand.

Stratton had raised about $1 million but had about $666,000 on hand as of the end of June. Pritzker hasn’t put his full financial might behind Stratton yet, which could boost her fundraising totals and put Kelly up against more financial firepower. Kelly said she believes she can compete regardless of the financial landscape of the primary race.

“I would not have gotten into the race if I didn’t think I would have the resources to win,” Kelly said. “And I’m looking at what I’m doing and what I need to do – yeah they could spend more money, I know that’s a possibility, but again, my races have always been powered by the people.”

She cited recent examples of races around the country where the winning candidate didn’t raise or spend the most money. Kelly previously told voters at an event in Peoria earlier this month that she wants to get money out of campaigns but said in an interview that would have to be done through the legislative process.

Leaning on experience

Kelly, of Matteson, said her experience at a variety of levels of government sets her apart from her opponents. She also argued her ability to pass legislation is something voters want.

As an elected official, Kelly has represented Illinois’ 2nd Congressional District since 2013 after winning a crowded special election to succeed former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., who resigned from Congress and later went to prison after pleading guilty to fraud charges. Jackson is now reported to be interested in running again for Kelly’s open seat.

Before serving in Congress, Kelly served two terms in the Illinois House before becoming chief of staff to then-Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias in the late 2000s. In 2010, she mounted an unsuccessful campaign to be Giannoulias’ successor, coming up short to Republican Dan Rutherford. After the failed 2010 campaign, Kelly became a top staffer for Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle until she was elected to Congress in the 2013 special election.

Kelly sought to elevate her stature in the Democratic Party of Illinois in 2021 after Mike Madigan resigned his role as party chair. Kelly won an internal party vote for the chairmanship over Chicago Ald. Michelle Harris, who was backed by Pritzker. But the following year, Pritzker-backed Rep. Lisa Hernandez, D-Cicero, successfully ousted Kelly.

“The people in the party, they know me, they know the work that I’ve done,” Kelly previously told Capitol News Illinois following an event in Peoria. “Despite what happened, I’ve still been an effective leader.”

Kelly pointed to her legislative experience, saying “I get things done.”

Gun violence prevention

Preventing gun violence has been one of Kelly’s top priorities in Congress. She earned national headlines in 2016 when she led a sit-in in the U.S. House alongside late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., and Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., to protest the lack of gun restrictions coming out of the Republican-controlled House. Kelly said one of her goals by staging the sit-in was to draw attention to individual lives lost to gun violence beyond headline-grabbing mass shootings.

Nine years after that protest, Kelly believes Democrats have moved the needle of public opinion on gun violence.

“People are hearing the message,” said Kelly, the vice chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. “Yes, gun violence might happen more in some places. But as you see, bullets don’t know zip codes.”

She pointed to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, a 2022 law designed to quell gun violence through stronger background checks and more mental health services.

“I think people are paying attention,” Kelly said. “We just have to make sure it’s not normalized.”

Kelly does not believe her strong stance on guns would be a deterrent for voters in a statewide election, partly because she already represents one of the most geographically diverse congressional districts in the state. Her district stretches from Chicago’s Hyde Park neighborhood through a narrow stretch of the city along Lake Michigan before picking up the bulk of the district’s population in south suburban Cook and Will counties. From there, the district stretches deep into central Illinois to Danville and Pontiac.

Kelly said she wouldn’t own a gun herself but understands the various reasons why people have one.

“It’s about gun safety. It’s not about taking your gun away,” she said.

Countering Trump

The primary race between the three high-profile Democrats has remained cordial as they have focused their political attacks on Republicans rather than each other. Each has been jockeying to set themselves up as the most vocal critic of the Trump administration.

Democrats will have to work to undo much of Trump’s accomplishments to address voters’ economic concerns if the party takes control of Congress, Kelly said.

“We will have to spend some time changing what’s already been put into law,” Kelly said.

While Trump sought to capitalize on economic concerns during last year’s election, Kelly said she believes he has lost high ground on the issue.

“He fooled the people since he said he was going to bring down prices on Day 1 while you see in the big, ugly bill that passed he kind of went the opposite way: taking away people’s health care; education is at stake, all those things,” she said.

Over the weekend, Trump claimed that Beyoncé broke the law after allegedly getting paid $11 million to appear at a Houston rally for Harris in October 2024.

This isn't the first time Bey has been accused of receiving eight figures to endorse the Democratic candidate. Last year, Trump supporters circulated rumors that Harris' campaign had paid Beyoncé $10 million for her rally appearance.

However, there is no basis or evidence to support any of these claims. Federal campaign records show Harris' campaign paid Beyoncé’s production company $165,000, a payment that was listed as a ""campaign event production"" expense. A Harris campaign spokesperson said last year that they didn't pay for celebrity endorsements, but they were required by law to cover costs connected to their event appearances.

The White House has yet to provide evidence of Trump's $11 million payment claim. When the president referred to the alleged eight-figure payment last year, Trump simply said: “Somebody just showed me something. They gave her $11 million.”

Amid Trump's latest comments, a Harris spokesperson cited remarks from Beyoncé’s mother, Tina Knowles, who said in November that the $10 million payment was a “lie."" Knowles also noted that the claim was taken down by Instagram as “False Information.” A spokesperson for Beyoncé also previously stated that the allegation was “beyond ridiculous.”

Trump on Sunday (July 27) also criticized other payments from the Harris campaign to organizations connected to prominent endorsers.

“Kamala, and all of those that received Endorsement money, BROKE THE LAW. They should all be prosecuted! Thank you for your attention to this matter,"" he wrote."

That's due to a number of changes in President Donald Trump's so-called ""big beautiful bill"" that will affect many current and future federal student loan borrowers.

Watch NBC 5 free wherever you are WATCH HERE WATCH HERE

The bill undoes several of the reforms President Joe Biden made during his time in office, such as protections for defrauded borrowers. It also eliminates repayment options and benefits like economic hardship deferrals that predate the Biden administration.

Historically, federal student loans have generally been a better deal for borrowers, Kate Wood, a lending expert at NerdWallet, tells CNBC Make It. The coming changes won't necessarily make federal loans a ""poor choice,"" she says, but the decision may not be as obvious as it once was.

Lesley Turner, an associate professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy, agrees. Turner has published several research papers on the role and impact of federal financing in higher education and previously served as an economic adviser within the Department of Education.

""By reducing the available protections for federal student loans, all else equal, that does make private student loans more attractive,"" Turner says.

Federal vs. private student loans

If you're weighing private versus federal student loans to pay for your education, there are generally five major factors to consider. Here's a look at each.

1. Eligibility

If you're enrolled at least part-time at an academic institution that participates in the federal direct loan program, you may be eligible to receive federal student loans.

You must submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid to see if you qualify, but there are no income limits. You must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, have a valid Social Security number, not be in default on another federal student loan and have a high school diploma or equivalent credential.

Private student loans are subject to lender approval. It can be very difficult to get approved for a loan with poor or no credit history, but you can apply with a cosigner. You may have to meet enrollment, income and other eligibility requirements, depending on the lender.

2. Repayment plan options

Currently, federal student loan borrowers have several options for repayment plans that best fit their needs. There's a standard repayment plan that keeps monthly payments fixed over the life of the loan and several income-driven repayment plans that are designed to make monthly payments affordable for lower-income borrowers. On the latter plans, borrowers have to certify their income annually, which can raise or lower monthly payments.

Trump's policy bill narrows the number of available payment plans for future borrowers. Borrowers currently on the Pay as You Earn, Saving on a Valuable Education and Income-Contingent income-driven repayment plans will have to switch payment plans as the policy eliminates these options. But those borrowers will still have a standard and an income-driven repayment option.

Private student loan terms can vary by lender and loan, Wood says. You'll typically have better options with federal loans as private loans typically don't offer income-driven payment plans. Repayment timelines are often shorter for private loans too, ranging from eight to 12 years, compared with up to 25 years for federal loans.

3. Interest rates

All federal student loan interest rates are fixed for the life of the loan and determined by Congress each year. For the upcoming 2025-26 school year, they are 6.39% for undergraduate loans, 7.94% for graduate loans and 8.94% for parent and grad PLUS loans. Borrowers don't need a credit history to qualify and a good or bad credit score won't impact their interest rate.

Undergraduate borrowers with demonstrated financial need have access to direct subsidized loans. With these loans, the federal government pays the interest while the borrower is in school and during certain deferment periods. Unsubsidized and subsidized loans have the same fixed interest rates.

With private loans, however, your interest rate may be fixed or variable, depending on your loan terms. Lenders assign interest rates depending on the broader rate environment and borrowers' creditworthiness.

It's feasible some creditworthy borrowers — or borrowers who have a cosigner with good credit — could get a better interest rate with a private loan. But it's fairly uncommon, Turner says.

She cites a 2012 Consumer Financial Protection Borrower study — ""the best evidence we have,"" she says — that found the average student loan borrower was always offered a higher interest rate from private lenders than the federal interest rate.

4. Flexibility

A major advantage of federal student loans has been the economic hardship and unemployment deferments that allow current borrowers to pause their monthly payments for a limited period of time when experiencing certain financial hardships, Wood says.

Currently, borrowers can receive economic hardship and unemployment deferments for up to three years and general forbearances for a maximum of 12 months at a time.

However, Trump's policy reforms eliminate these options for future borrowers. Anyone who takes out loans after July 1, 2027 will be required to make monthly payments unless their loan servicer approves a general forbearance for situations like financial difficulties, medical expenses or changes in employment. The new policy will limit forbearances to a maximum of nine months in a two-year period.

""On one hand, that's a lot worse than it used to be, but that's probably still better than what a lot of private lenders are going to offer you,"" Wood says.

There's no law or regulation requiring private lenders to help you out if you fall on hard times while paying back your loan. Like credit card companies or other lenders, you may be able to negotiate a pause on your payments for a brief period if you have a good relationship with the lender and a history of on-time payments, but ""it may come down to what your loan agreement allows,"" Wood adds.

Plus, interest will likely continue accruing if you do successfully pause private loan payments, while interest may be paused for some federal loan forbearance periods.

5. Loan limits

Though federal student loans may offer better terms, you may be limited in the amount you can borrow. Undergraduate dependent borrowers have a lifetime limit of $31,000 and annual limits depending on what year of school you're entering. The annual limits are as follows:

First-year undergraduate: $5,500

$5,500 Second-year undergraduate: $6,500

$6,500 Third year and beyond undergraduate: $7,500

Graduate and professional students have an annual loan limit of $20,500 and a lifetime limit of $138,500 including any amounts borrowed in undergrad. Grad students and parents of undergraduate students can also currently borrow up to the cost of attendance after any aid through PLUS loans, which have higher interest rates and slightly different protections than federal direct loans.

The new law doesn't change the current loan limits for undergraduate students, but it does impose lower borrowing limits for graduate loans and parents taking out loans on behalf of undergraduate students by eliminating grad PLUS loans and capping parent PLUS loans for undergraduate students at $20,000 per student per year, up to an overall total of $65,000 per student.

After July 1, 2026, grad students will be able to borrow up to $20,500 a year and a maximum of $100,000 over the course of their studies — not including undergraduate borrowing — or $50,000 a year and $200,000 in total for professional studies like law or medicine.

For private loans, however, ""ostensibly, no limits exist,"" Wood says. The amount a borrower can receive is up to the lender's discretion.

""The amount that they're going to be open to lending you is going to depend on your characteristics as a borrower,"" Wood says. ""Is your credit strong? Do you pay your bills on time? Are you likely to pay back this loan? The stronger financially that you are, the more a lender will be open to lending you.""

The bottom line

Though the list of benefits may be shrinking, both Wood and Turner recommend students and families exhaust their federal student loan options first before turning to private lenders if they need to borrow to pay for school.

""For the majority of borrowers, federal loans will be the better product in terms of both interest rates and the protections that continue to exist after the [new Repayment Assistance Plan] goes into effect,"" Turner says.

Not everyone will qualify for federal student loans, but you won't know until you file a FAFSA. The FAFSA determines whether you qualify for federal grants and scholarships that you don't have to pay back, as well as federal loans.

""Everybody should still be submitting your FAFSA,"" Wood says. ""You're not committing to anything. You're just finding out what you could get.""

Roy Cooper as “Radical Roy,” as he officially declared his candidacy for the state’s key 2026 Senate race.

The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, launched a website describing Cooper’s gubernatorial record as “woke” and “weak” and calling him a “radical liberal in disguise.” The $200,000 purchase covers “a texting campaign, plus Google and X ads,” according to Punchbowl News. (RELATED: Former Gov. Roy Cooper Reportedly Entering North Carolina Senate Race)

A press release by the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) called Cooper “a wreck.”

The NRSC’s video told viewers that Cooper isn’t one of “the people you trust in the driver’s seat,” because he “crashed schools, revved up your taxes, and took a hard left on crime – letting violent criminals cruise free. Then he floored it on radical gender ideology – letting men race in women’s lanes.”

The video also pointed out the former governor’s handling of Hurricane Helene in 2024, stating, “When disaster hit North Carolina, Roy hit cruise control and showed up three days later – leaving residents nowhere to go.”

“Roy Cooper is a Democrat lapdog who spent his time as Governor sabotaging President Trump, doing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’ bidding, releasing violent illegal aliens into North Carolina streets, and championing radical transgender ideology,” National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) Communications Director Joanna Rodriguez said in a statement.

“North Carolina wants a senator who will champion working families, safety, and American values, not an incompetent, far-left career politician like Cooper who will wreck everything they care about,” Rodriguez added.

There are people you trust in the driver’s seat. Roy Cooper isn’t one of them. He crashed schools, revved up taxes, and took a hard left on crime. When disaster hit North Carolina, he hit cruise control and showed up 3 days later. Cooper isn’t just off course, he’s a WRECK. pic.twitter.com/w07kecSKKL — Senate Republicans (@NRSC) July 28, 2025



An NRSC press release called attention to State Rep. Brenden Jones’ 2024 statement that Cooper “failed the people of eastern North Carolina,” as well as the former governor’s commutation of sentences for convicted murderers and a rapist on death row.

Senate Leadership Fund Executive Director Alex Latcham released a statement that “Chuck Schumer might be celebrating, but North Carolinians are still reeling from extreme liberal Roy Cooper’s botched response to Hurricane Helene that left over 100 people dead.”

“His pardons of violent criminals, and his vetoes that allowed boys in girls’ sports and forced higher taxes on working families,” Latcham’s statement continued, “so while Washington Democrats toast themselves for convincing a far-left career politician to seek another taxpayer job, we’ll be reminding North Carolina voters about the families Radical Roy Cooper devastated.”

Several outlets reported that Cooper would run for North Carolina’s open Senate seat on Wednesday, so Republicans were seemingly prepared when Cooper officially announced his bid for the Senate on Monday.

The hotly contested Senate race follows incumbent Republican North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis’ retirement announcement in June. A source confirmed to the Daily Caller News Foundation that Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman Michael Whatley will enter the 2026 North Carolina Senate race with support from President Donald Trump, after former RNC Co-Chair Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law, decided not to run.

The North Carolina Senate race is poised to be hotly contested. Trump won the battleground state by narrow margins in all three of his presidential campaigns, with him besting failed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris there by just over three percentage points.

Widely described as a top Democratic Senate recruit, Cooper served as the state’s governor from 2017 to 2025. He won both the 2016 and 2020 gubernatorial elections while Trump simultaneously carried the state.

Cooper’s campaign did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Al Sharpton on Monday rejected President Donald Trump’s claims that he was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to endorse former Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign during the 2024 election cycle.

“Absolutely not,” Sharpton said during an interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe when asked if he was paid to endorse Harris. He further accused Trump of using the allegations as a last-ditch attempt to distract from fallout over his administration’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case, arguing that the president is “trying to flood the zone to take any pressure off of him and try to put his MAGA base back together again.”

The saga started in October 2024 when Sharpton, an MSNBC anchor, brought Harris on the network for what critics described as a softball interview as she campaigned against Trump to become the country’s next president.

Federal Election Commission filings scrutinized after the interview showed that Harris donated $500,000 to Sharpton’s nonprofit organization, the National Action Network, weeks before the media sitdown, leading Trump and other Republicans to accuse the reverend of being financially bribed to support her struggling campaign.

Sharpton acknowledged Monday that National Action Network received the funds, but he denied that such an action represented a conflict of interest and argued that neither he nor his nonprofit organization ever directly endorsed Harris. A defamation lawsuit against Trump could be coming, the reverend threatened, because the president “had knowledge this time that there was no endorsement and that I didn’t get any money.”

“This went to the nonprofit that I’m connected to,” Sharpton said.

Sharpton stopped just short of endorsing Harris during a speech at the Democratic National Convention in August 2024. Noting that his National Action Network makes it a policy not to endorse presidential candidates, Sharpton told the crowd that with Harris, “We are now on our way to the Oval Office. We won’t go back.”

Sharpton’s dig at Trump this week came after the president on Saturday called for the reverend and other Democratic-aligned celebrities to be prosecuted for allegedly being bribed to endorse the Harris campaign.

“YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PAY FOR AN ENDORSEMENT,” Trump wrote in a post to Truth Social. “IT IS TOTALLY ILLEGAL TO DO SO. Can you imagine what would happen if politicians started paying for people to endorse them. All hell would break out! Kamala, and all of those that received Endorsement money, BROKE THE LAW.”

Other celebrities Trump has accused of endorsing Harris in exchange for money include Beyoncé.

MSNBC ‘UNWARE’ HARRIS CAMPAIGN DONATED $500K TO AL SHARPTON NONPROFIT BEFORE FRIENDLY INTERVIEW

There were rumors in October 2024 that the Harris campaign paid Beyoncé $10 million to endorse the then-vice president’s bid against Trump with a speech at a Houston rally. While the event attracted large crowds amid the widespread belief that the Grammy-winning artist was set to perform, Beyoncé gave only a brief address expressing support for Harris “as a mother.”

The Harris team vigorously rebuffed claims of a bribed endorsement as lies, with FEC filings showing no record of such a $10 million payment. However, FEC records released following the election showed that the former vice president’s campaign paid Beyonce’s production company $165,000."

Posted/updated on: July 28, 2025 at 12:57 pm

(WASHINGTON) -- Roy Cooper, the former Democratic governor of North Carolina, officially launched his Senate bid for Republican Sen. Thom Tillis' open seat in 2026 on Monday.

“I'm Roy Cooper, and I know that today, for too many Americans, the middle class feels like a distant dream. Meanwhile, the biggest corporations and the richest Americans have grabbed unimaginable wealth at your expense. It's time for that to change,” Cooper said in an announcement video posted on X.

In his announcement, Cooper said he believes that the next election will determine “if we even have a middle class in America anymore.” He doesn’t mention President Donald Trump directly.

“Right now, our country is facing a moment as fragile as any I can remember, and the decisions we make in the next election will determine if we even have a middle class in America anymore. I never really wanted to go to Washington. I just wanted to serve the people of North Carolina, right here where I've lived all my life. But these are not ordinary times. Politicians in D.C. are running up our debt, ripping away our health care, disrespecting our veterans, cutting health for the poor, and even putting Medicare and Social Security at risk just to give tax breaks to billionaires. That's wrong, and I've had enough.”

The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) responded to the news in a statement slamming Cooper as both ""far left"" and anti-Trump, alongside attempting to tie him to former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris.

“Roy Cooper is a Democrat lapdog who spent his time as Governor sabotaging President Trump, doing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' bidding,” NRSC Communications Director Joanna Rodriguez said partly in a statement. “When Hurricane Helene hit, Cooper's gross mismanagement left over 100 North Carolinians dead and an estimated $53 billion in damage to businesses, homes, and infrastructure. North Carolina wants a senator who will champion working families, safety, and American values, not an incompetent, far-left career politician like Cooper who will wreck everything they care about.”

As for the Republicans’ pick, multiple sources tell ABC News that RNC Chair Michael Whatley is planning to launch a bid after being asked directly by Trump to run. Trump is hopeful that Whatley, who led the North Carolina Republican Party before becoming RNC chair, has the knowledge of the state, the national profile and the network of relationships to run a strong campaign.

Tillis said in June that he would not seek reelection, citing “the political theatre and partisan gridlock in Washington” and as Trump railed against him for opposing his signature megabill.

She also cleared the usage of her 2016 song ""Freedom"" for Harris, and the tune became the Democratic nominee's official campaign song.

""I'm looking at the large amount of money owed by the Democrats after the presidential election and the fact that they admit to paying, probably illegally, $11 million dollars to singer Beyoncé for an ENDORSEMENT (she never sang, not one note...),"" wrote Trump in a fiery Truth Social post, also citing alleged endorsement payments to media mogul Oprah Winfrey and civil rights activist Al Sharpton.

USA TODAY has reached out to a representative for Beyoncé for comment.

""Can you imagine what would happen if politicians started paying for people to endorse them. All hell would break out!"" Trump concluded. ""Kamala and all of those that received endorsement money BROKE THE LAW. They should all be prosecuted! Thank you for your attention to this matter.""

Trump's digital tirade comes just two months after he accused the Grammy-winning singer and other celebrities of being paid to publicly support Harris' candidacy. In a May Truth Social post, the GOP president announced plans for a ""major investigation"" into the Harris campaign's celebrity endorsements.

Did Beyoncé receive payment for Kamala Harris endorsement?

At the time of Trump's original allegations in May, the Federal Election Commission had no record of an $11 million payment to Beyoncé from Harris' presidential campaign. Additionally, the agency does not have rules explicitly prohibiting candidates from paying for endorsements.

It is unclear where Trump got the unsubstantiated $11 million figure. The Harris campaign last year rejected a rumor that it paid Beyoncé $10 million for her endorsement that spread on social media shortly after the music star's October 2024 appearance with Harris.

Beyoncé's mother, Tina Knowles, also pushed back at the $10 million rumor in a November 2024 Instagram post, calling it ""false information"" and a ""lie."" She added that the singer ""actually paid for her own flights for her and her team.""

What has Beyoncé said about Kamala Harris campaign?

During her October 2024 appearance at Harris' rally, Beyoncé, who was joined by fellow singer and Destiny's Child alum Kelly Rowland, said ""It's time for America to sing a new song"" when describing Harris' presidential bid.

""I'm not here as a celebrity. I'm not here as a politician. I'm here as a mother,"" the pop star added. ""Your freedom is your God-given right, your human right.""

Harris, who is reportedly deciding between a race for California’s governor’s mansion in 2026 and another presidential bid in 2028, would likely be unable to shake prior decisions Democrats are reluctant to face, such as Joe Biden’s decision to run for reelection in 2024 and her rise to become the party’s presidential nominee without a primary after Biden’s withdrawal. Even in the deep blue state, Harris’ critics worry that her fellow party members not being too keen on her possible attempted comeback could weaken Democrats’ chances of winning in California’s several swing congressional seats, CNN reported. (RELATED: Dem Donors Not Jumping For Joy Over Idea Of Kamala Harris Comeback)

“There’s no groundswell for her candidacy. In fact, I think it would only fire up Republicans and hurt our ability to win the four to five seats that we need to win to win the House and hold on to three seats that we just flipped in 2024,” one California House Democrat, who requested anonymity to speak freely, told the outlet. “She comes in with baggage.”

Some Democrats in competitive districts, such as first-term California Reps. Dave Min and George Whitesides, were hesitant to comment on the gubernatorial race. When asked how his reelection prospects would change if Harris were to run for the governor’s mansion, Min told the outlet he had no comment at all.

“I welcome her to the race. I’m just really focused on my own race, but if that’s what she feels calls to do, that’s her prerogative,” Whitesides told the paper.

The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the 2026 races in both Min and Whitesides’ Southern California seats as “Lean Democrat.”

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who according to Hunter Biden did not want Harris to be the presidential nominee following his father’s departure from the 2024 race, told CNN, “I want her to do whatever she wants to do.” Pelosi continues to represent most of San Francisco in Congress.

The former vice president has reportedly reached out to former California governors for their opinion on if she could do the job, but some did not agree to speak with her, according to CNN.

California Rep. Jimmy Gomez, who has represented his Los Angeles district for nine years, implied that running for governor was Harris’ backup plan after losing the 2024 election to President Donald Trump.

“Once you’re the vice president of the United States, there’s only one place to go. It’s president,” Gomez told CNN. “For me, if I was vice president and all of a sudden I lose, it would be a fallback to me. I hate to put it so bluntly.”

FLASHBACK: Kamala Harris Repeatedly Lied To America About Biden’s Cognitive Declinehttps://t.co/4AXwoI3B4s — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) July 23, 2024

California Rep. Mike Levin, who represents areas of Orange County and San Diego County, was more encouraging towards Harris, claiming her knowledge of the state and electorate would make her a “formidable candidate.” Cook rates the 2026 race in Levin’s seat as “Likely Democrat.”

California Rep. Ro Khanna — who has represented parts of California’s Silicon Valley since 2016 — supports a gubernatorial bid from Harris.

“As someone who served as district attorney, attorney general and senator from California, she would have the experience, leadership and understanding of the state legislature to tackle two of the biggest problems in the state: the lack of affordable housing and a sense of a lack of public safety,” Khanna told CNN.

As Harris continues to bide her time the California governor’s race is shaping up.

Already declared Democratic candidates in the race include former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, former California Attorney General and Biden-era Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, former State Controller Betty Yee, Lt. Governor Eleni Kounalakis, former Orange County Rep. Katie Porter, entrepreneur Stephen J. Cloobeck, former State Senate President pro tempore Toni Atkins and state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond.

Republicans in the running include Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, former Fox News host Steve Hilton, former judge Jimmy Parker, former businessman Leo Zacky and business consultant Sharifah Hardie, among others.

Harris’ office did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

CNN chief data analyst Harry Enten expressed surprise on Monday about how Americans trust Republicans more than Democrats when it comes to foreign policy, despite ongoing global conflicts.

A Fox News poll conducted in July found Republicans have a three-point advantage on foreign policy, while a Wall Street Journal poll found the GOP with an eight-point advantage in July, Enten said. On “CNN News Central,” Enten asserted the data was “surprising” because of foreign policy issues taking place under the Republican-controlled government.

WATCH:

“This one was a surprising one to me, given everything that’s going on in Russia, what happened in Iran, what happened in Gaza. But the bottom line is: Democrats in the American voters’ minds cannot hack it,” Enten said. “What are we talking about? Party trusted more on foreign policy. Well, the GOP holds an average six-point lead in the month of July. Look at this. Fox News came out last week, plus three points for Republicans on foreign policy over the Democrats.”

“You think that number is not high enough for you? How about the Wall Street Journal? GOP plus eight points when they match congressional Democrats up against congressional Republicans,” he continued. “The bottom line is this: despite everything that’s going on in the world right now, Republicans are more trusted [than] Democrats when it comes to foreign policy and the world at large.”

CNN anchor John Berman asked Enten how the numbers compare to those during the 2024 presidential campaign.

“Again, this to me was a surprising number since [President] Donald Trump said he’d come in and broker all these peace deals. And while he’s brokered some, he hasn’t obviously brokered one between Ukraine and Russia,” Enten said. “And obviously the situation in Gaza. But take a look here. Trust more on foreign policy. You go back to 2024. Trump had a six-point advantage over [former Vice President] Kamala Harris. Again, look at the average right now. It hasn’t moved despite everything that‘s going on in the world. You see Republicans plus six points here.”

“Despite any misgivings that the American public might have about Donald Trump, when you match up Republicans against Democrats, Donald Trump against Democrats, still, at this particular point, they are doing significantly better than you might expect,” he added. “And when it comes to the issue of foreign policy, again, what you see is in the American voters’ minds, Democrats, simply put, can’t hack it. More voters trust Republicans on foreign policy very much like they did back during the 2024 campaign.”

Trump told reporters on Monday that he would drastically shorten the deadline for Russian President Vladimir Putin to come to a ceasefire deal with Ukraine from 50 days to “10 or 12 days” during his meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland. The president threatened to implement sweeping secondary tariffs and sanctions against crucial Russian industries if a deal was not reached.

Recent polling by CNN and The Wall Street Journal also found that Democrats’ favorability ratings have plunged to 28% and 33%, respectively.

Over the weekend, Trump claimed that Beyoncé broke the law after allegedly getting paid $11 million to appear at a Houston rally for Harris in October 2024.

This isn't the first time Bey has been accused of receiving eight figures to endorse the Democratic candidate. Last year, Trump supporters circulated rumors that Harris' campaign had paid Beyoncé $10 million for her rally appearance.

However, there is no basis or evidence to support any of these claims. Federal campaign records show Harris' campaign paid Beyoncé’s production company $165,000, a payment that was listed as a ""campaign event production"" expense. A Harris campaign spokesperson said last year that they didn't pay for celebrity endorsements, but they were required by law to cover costs connected to their event appearances.

The White House has yet to provide evidence of Trump's $11 million payment claim. When the president referred to the alleged eight-figure payment last year, Trump simply said: “Somebody just showed me something. They gave her $11 million.”

Amid Trump's latest comments, a Harris spokesperson cited remarks from Beyoncé’s mother, Tina Knowles, who said in November that the $10 million payment was a “lie."" Knowles also noted that the claim was taken down by Instagram as “False Information.” A spokesperson for Beyoncé also previously stated that the allegation was “beyond ridiculous.”

Trump on Sunday (July 27) also criticized other payments from the Harris campaign to organizations connected to prominent endorsers.

“Kamala, and all of those that received Endorsement money, BROKE THE LAW. They should all be prosecuted! Thank you for your attention to this matter,"" he wrote."

As industries that depend on temporary workers like agriculture and tourism say they need greater latitude to hire immigrant workers to address labor shortages, some GOP lawmakers have sought to qualify their party’s tough-on-immigration approach with an exception to employ noncitizens in those sectors legally.

That became apparent last month during the House Appropriations Committee’s markup of the fiscal 2026 Homeland Security spending bill. Republicans adopted an en banc amendment that would expand opportunities for employers to hire immigrants for certain temporary work, including the agricultural, tourism and circus industries.

The amendment, adopted by voice vote, was jointly introduced by Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., with bipartisan support from Reps. Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., Chuck Edwards, R-N.C., and Henry Cuellar, D-Texas.

Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Nev., chair of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, acknowledged the need to hire immigrants in some sectors as a component of immigration reform.

“How amazing would it be if this administration led an immigration reform,” Amodei said.

“Nobody’s not open to facts, so tell me those facts, whether it’s agriculture, whether it’s hospitality industry, whether it’s construction, whether it’s, you name it,” Amodei said. “And so, it’s like, let’s have a factual conversation now.”

Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, also acknowledged the need to include workers in certain sectors in any immigration reform.

He said the federal government has made it “very difficult for farmers to even hire people, whether it’s the wage rate or the requirements of housing, all these things.

“Let’s start fixing the existing programs we have,” he said.

Still, he acknowledged that lawmakers had not focused on that. Asked whether he expects it to happen in the future, Scott replied, “I hope so.”

Amodei noted that the Trump administration recently adopted a policy to lay off on immigration raids in industries like agriculture and hospitality. That policy, however, was rescinded after criticism from his conservative base.

“The most frustrating thing about immigration reform is the pieces are there,” he said. “You don’t have to commit political suicide to put those pieces together.”

The amendment adopted by the House Appropriations Committee has many components that would expand the ability of employers to hire immigrant laborers in certain temporary industries. It would allow employers an exemption from the cap to hire workers on H-2B visas, expand the period for H-2A agricultural visas for a full year and create a new category of P visas to hire immigrants for mobile entertainment like carnivals and circuses.

Amodei said approval of that amendment sparked conversations about how to ensure an adequate workforce for industries like agriculture and tourism, as well as the circus industry.

Harris, Amodei said, was set to speak with House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, to address issues such as whether the appropriations committee or the authorizing committee would have jurisdiction over expanding visas, including H-2A, H2-B and the new category of P visas.

Amodei lamented the House Judiciary Committee not taking the lead on the issue, which he indicated has forced his subcommittee’s hand.

“The frustrating thing is — I have no disrespect at all,” Amodei said. “I have nothing but respect for it. This is your jurisdiction, but answering this issue with ‘no.’ And it’s like, well, is your mousetrap better? Trot your mousetrap out here. Come on. That’s the process. It’s the legislative branch.”

‘Security, then reform’

Some Republicans and experts with hardline approaches said they saw opportunities for expanding visas, as long as other matters in immigration are also addressed.

Kenneth Cuccinelli, a top official with the Homeland Security Department during the first Trump administration, said expanding opportunities to hire immigrants in certain industries would be beneficial, provided that deportation efforts continue. He’s now a senior fellow for immigration and homeland security at the conservative Center for Renewing America.

“I think that they first have to get smooth, effective deportation processes at large scale in place,” Cuccinelli said. “It goes with the security first, and then reform, but as part of a broader reform package that focuses on employment, instead of, say, chain migration and getting rid of the diversity lottery, that would be an improvement.”

Rep. Michael Guest, R-Miss., chair of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement, said he would expect interest in expanding employment opportunities for immigrants in certain sectors that depend on H-2A and H-2B visas. But he drew a distinction between that and a more generalized approach.

H-2A visas are for temporary agriculture workers, while H-2B are for temporary non-agricultural workers. Currently, there is no annual cap for H-2A visas, but Congress has set the H-2B cap at 66,000 per fiscal year.

“I think as a whole, any sort of pathway to citizenship would be not looked upon favorably by many members of the Republican Party,” Guest said. “But I do think as you’re looking at ways in which we can offer individuals the ability who are properly vetted to come in the country and work in some of our very vital industries, such as agriculture, I do think that there would be widespread bipartisan support for a program along those lines.”

H-2A Visas

From fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2023, the number of approved H-2A jobs and visas increased by more than 50 percent, with the State Department issuing nearly 310,000 H-2A visas in fiscal 2023, according to the Government Accountability Office.

David J. Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, said either expanding these caps or otherwise being able to hire more immigrant workers is a “big priority” for the industries that use these visas.

“They want to be able to be assured that they’ll get a visa at the end of the process,” Bier said, “And that’s, right now, the biggest uncertainty with H-2B. You can go through the whole process and the cap is used up, and you don’t get anything out of it.”

Bier said employers are concerned about cost escalation with continuous rules changes for H-2A visas in agriculture, citing changing rules under the Biden administration. Immigrant workers make up 15 percent to 20 percent of the agricultural labor force, he said.

The biggest growth area for H-2A agricultural visas, Bier said, would be expanding the duration of the visa to make them year-round. For H-2B visas, Bier said that would be expanding the cap, which he said is far below demand.

Employers’ efforts to lobby for changes is “quite minimal,” Bier said, because of the political prospects under the Trump administration.

“There’s just so much internal division within the Republican Party on the topic,” Bier said. “There are a lot of Republicans who are like, ‘Sure, hire people on visas.’ But there are also a lot who just think, ‘Well, you should only ever hire an American.’ You know, that’s more where the White House is on it, although there’s some division within the administration on the topic.”

Hesitations

Many Republicans were cautious about the idea of opening up more opportunities to hire immigrants legally to work in certain sectors amid a strong focus on mass deportation.

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, was dismissive when asked whether he’d like to expand opportunities to hire immigrant workers in certain sectors.

“Not really, not that I think of off the top of my head,” Hawley said. “I think we want to incentivize employers to hire more Americans. We want them to hire them on higher wages.”

Asked whether there were any discussions among lawmakers about expanding employment opportunities for immigrants, he joked: “Probably, but they wouldn’t include me.”

Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, a member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security and Enforcement. said “nope” categorically when asked whether he sees any opportunities to expand legal immigration.

“We’ve suffered for four years from open borders, millions of people coming across the border illegally, ravaging our communities, not just from the drugs and the crime, but from a massive influx of what amounts to cheap labor and drives down wages for working-class Americans,” Gill said. “I don’t think they’re in the appetite to expand that, certainly not on the illegal side, and not on the legal side either.”

Immigration raids took place earlier this month in Southern California at two marijuana farms that hired undocumented workers, resulting in confrontation between migrant workers and federal immigration officers.

The U.S. government said it arrested more than 360 people, including migrants with criminal records. The Department of Homeland Security initially said 10 immigrant children were found at the farms, and later increased that number to 14.

Rep. Josh Brecheen, R-Okla., chair of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations and Accountability, said an “implementation period” for Trump’s plan to deport migrants in the United States illegally must be complete before discussion could begin on expanding legal pathways for immigrants.

“For years, we’ve talked about securing the border before those conversations happen, so I think we are still premature until we get a secure border,” Brecheen said."

I’m sure there will be proposals for Maryland to do it, though we can only switch one district,” emailed Steve Shapiro, the original complainant in the well-known Maryland redistricting case, Shapiro v. McManus, to me on July 20.

As the first to challenge Maryland’s congressional district apportionment for the 2010 decade, I was heartened two days later (July 22) when House of Delegates Majority Leader, Del. David H. Moon (D-Montgomery Co.), announced his plan to draft legislation that would automatically redistrict Maryland if other states engage in out-of-cycle redrawing of congressional districts.

On my 81st birthday, July 16, President Donald Trump (R) urged Texas to redraw its congressional map, enabling the Republican Party to gain seats in the 2026 midterm elections during a special session. Soon afterward, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) proposed dismantling California’s voter-approved redistricting system to counter Texas’s efforts to redraw congressional districts. Ohio, with 10 Republican representatives and five Democratic representatives, is set to redraw its congressional district lines this September or October. Now, another red state, Florida, should consider overhauling its congressional districts between censuses. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) is open to redrawing House lines only if other states violate the rules. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) hosted Texas state legislators on Friday in Oakwood, IL, to respond to Republican congressional redistricting plans. Trump encouraged Missouri lawmakers to redraw their congressional map to gain one GOP seat. Oregon must redraw its congressional districts next time to prevent prison gerrymandering, but when? Washington state lawmakers believe that their Redistricting Commission won’t redraw before next year’s midterms. New Jersey Democrats will probably need to change the law to draw a new map only if the NJ court permits.

The Princeton Gerrymandering Project has graded the states as mentioned above: California “B” (43-to-9 Democratic advantage), Florida “F” (20-to-8 R), Illinois “F” (14-to-3 D), Maryland “B” (7-to-1 D), Missouri “A” (6-to-2 R), New Jersey “A” (9-to-3 D), New York “A” (19-to-7 D), Ohio “D” (10-to-5 R), Oregon “D” (5-to-1 D), Texas “F” (25-to-12 R with one vacancy), and Washington “A” (8-to-2 D). These grades indicate the level of fairness and transparency in each state’s redistricting process, with ‘A’ representing the highest level of fairness and ‘F’ the lowest.

That prompted Del. Moon to wave the Maryland flag, a symbolic gesture often used to attract attention or rally support for Maryland’s potential response to out-of-cycle redistricting.

In 2018, Del. Moon had to answer a Question on the Redistricting asked by the League of Women Voters of Maryland: “What changes, if any, do you support in the process for drawing congressional and legislative district lines in Maryland?” He wrote:

“When an entire legislative body can be drawn independently, we should do so. That’s why I support independent redistricting for state legislative districts. But when district lines are drawn piecemeal, as happens in Congress, I support nationwide independent redistricting. In the meantime, I’ve cosponsored bills to push Maryland into treaties with other states to adopt this reform regionally.”

Before becoming a Delegate in January 2015, Moon ran a blog called Maryland Juice 1.0.

It might be more interesting to read his 2011 blog titled “What Happens in Georgia Stays in Maryland: Trading Rep. Bartlett for Rep. Barrow.”

Now, Del. Moon might trade the only Maryland Republican congressman, Andy Harris, for a different Democratic representative from another state, like Missouri’s Congressman Emanuel Cleaver.

Otherwise, how will Del. Moon’s fellow delegates redraw Rep. Harris’s 1st Congressional District to secure the last of the eight congressional districts for the Democrats? It might be simple to shift Harford County and most of Cecil County into the 2nd District. To attract more Democratic-registered voters to the 1st District, it could be redrawn across the 4.3-mile-long William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial (Chesapeake) Bay Bridge to include downtown Annapolis, including the State House, where the Governor’s family lives. Then, the legislators would redraw the boundaries of the other seven congressional districts based on the “Principle of Equal Population (One Person, One Vote).” As a result, the Princeton Gerrymandering Project would change Maryland’s grade from “B” to “D.”

President Trump could surpass President Barack Obama as the leading sitting advocate of gerrymandering. In 2009, the latter shocked anti-gerrymandering supporters by ignoring the redistricting reform bill proposed by Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), even though the Democratic-controlled House and Senate were in session. No Maryland congressional delegation co-sponsored Rep. Lofgren’s 2009 bill.

I left my comment on Delegate Moon’s Facebook page regarding his proposal. It says, “As an expert on the hypocrisy of gerrymandering, I look forward to seeing you, Delegate, in your Judiciary Committee in the coming session.”"

(WASHINGTON) — Roy Cooper, the former Democratic governor of North Carolina, officially launched his Senate bid for Republican Sen. Thom Tillis’ open seat in 2026 on Monday.

“I’m Roy Cooper, and I know that today, for too many Americans, the middle class feels like a distant dream. Meanwhile, the biggest corporations and the richest Americans have grabbed unimaginable wealth at your expense. It’s time for that to change,” Cooper said in an announcement video posted on X.

In his announcement, Cooper said he believes that the next election will determine “if we even have a middle class in America anymore.” He doesn’t mention President Donald Trump directly.

“Right now, our country is facing a moment as fragile as any I can remember, and the decisions we make in the next election will determine if we even have a middle class in America anymore. I never really wanted to go to Washington. I just wanted to serve the people of North Carolina, right here where I’ve lived all my life. But these are not ordinary times. Politicians in D.C. are running up our debt, ripping away our health care, disrespecting our veterans, cutting health for the poor, and even putting Medicare and Social Security at risk just to give tax breaks to billionaires. That’s wrong, and I’ve had enough.”

The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) responded to the news in a statement slamming Cooper as both “far left” and anti-Trump, alongside attempting to tie him to former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris.

“Roy Cooper is a Democrat lapdog who spent his time as Governor sabotaging President Trump, doing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’ bidding,” NRSC Communications Director Joanna Rodriguez said partly in a statement. “When Hurricane Helene hit, Cooper’s gross mismanagement left over 100 North Carolinians dead and an estimated $53 billion in damage to businesses, homes, and infrastructure. North Carolina wants a senator who will champion working families, safety, and American values, not an incompetent, far-left career politician like Cooper who will wreck everything they care about.”

As for the Republicans’ pick, multiple sources tell ABC News that RNC Chair Michael Whatley is planning to launch a bid after being asked directly by Trump to run. Trump is hopeful that Whatley, who led the North Carolina Republican Party before becoming RNC chair, has the knowledge of the state, the national profile and the network of relationships to run a strong campaign.

Tillis said in June that he would not seek reelection, citing “the political theatre and partisan gridlock in Washington” and as Trump railed against him for opposing his signature megabill.

While Taylor’s major-film debut in Cats bombed at the box office in 2019, as did her next screen effort, 2022’s Amsterdam, Carrie’s cameo on Cobra Kai in 2021 was deemed a success by fans and showbiz execs.

“Carrie thoroughly enjoyed [playing the part], and it would give her a lot of satisfaction to tackle a real role this time,” says an insider. “It would also be sweet to do what Taylor hasn’t been able to do and make inroads in that sphere,” the insider adds. “They’ve always been rivals, as everyone knows — there’s no love lost there.”

Carrie, 42, is keeping everyone guessing about whether or not she’ll return as a judge on American Idol next year, but in any case, she also plans on pursuing her acting ambitions.

“She’s spent time in L.A. doing Idol and feels she’s got a better grip on the acting scene now. It would be a great springboard whether she chooses to do another season of Idol or not,” says the insider.

Sources say the songbirds’ feud dates back to when Tay-Tay, 35, crossed over to pop, which Carrie felt dishonored the country music world.

Another source close to Taylor played down talk of a rivalry, adding: “Taylor has always respected her roots in country and put out two country albums last year.”

But they are on opposite sides politically, with Taylor supporting Kamala Harris, and the “Jesus, Take the Wheel” songstress performing “America the Beautiful” at President Donald Trump’s inauguration, which some said she did just to spite Taylor.

That hasn’t been Carrie’s only diss. On Idol, she made a dig that a contestant had a “Taylor Swift-esque” quality.

And Carrie and Brad Paisley once poked fun at Taylor’s dating history and political views at the CMAs… while Taylor was in the audience.

Adds the insider, “People used to make comparisons between Carrie and Taylor, which annoyed Carrie. Carrie likes to think of herself as No. 1. Now she seems to take pleasure out of stomping on Taylor’s toes.”"

As his administration faces mounting pressure to release Justice Department files related the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case, President Donald Trump is highlighting a different criminal justice issue — cashless bail.

He suggested in a Truth Social post this week that eliminating cash bail as a condition of pretrial release from jail has led to rising crime in U.S. cities that have enacted these reforms. However, studies have shown no clear link.

Here’s a closer look at the facts.

TRUMP: “Crime in American Cities started to significantly rise when they went to CASHLESS BAIL. The WORST criminals are flooding our streets and endangering even our great law enforcement officers. It is a complete disaster, and must be ended, IMMEDIATELY!”

THE FACTS: Data has not determined the impact of cashless bail on crime rates. But experts say it is incorrect to claim that there is an adverse connection.

“I don’t know of any valid studies corroborating the President’s claim and would love to know what the Administration offers in support,” said Kellen Funk, a professor at Columbia Law School who studies pretrial procedure and bail bonding. “In my professional judgment I’d call the claim demonstrably false and inflammatory.”

Jeff Clayton, executive director of the American Bail Coalition, the main lobbying arm of the cash bail industry, also pointed to a lack of evidence.

“Studies are inconclusive in terms of whether bail reforms have had an impact on overall crime numbers,” he said. “This is due to pretrial crime being a small subset of overall crime. It is also difficult to categorize reforms as being ‘cashless’ or not, i.e., policies where preventative detention is introduced as an alternative to being held on bail.”

Different jurisdictions, different laws

In 2023, Illinois became the first state to completely eliminate cash bail when the state Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law abolishing it. The move was part of an expansive criminal justice overhaul adopted in 2021 known as the SAFE-T Act. Under the change, a judge decides whether to release the defendant prior to their trial, weighing factors such as their criminal charges, if they could pose any danger to others and if they are considered a flight risk.

Loyola University of Chicago’s Center for Criminal Justice published a 2024 report on Illinois’ new cashless bail policy, one year after it went into effect. It acknowledges that there is not yet enough data to know what impact the law has had on crime, but that crime in Illinois did not increase after its implementation. Violent and property crime declined in some counties.

A number of other jurisdictions, including New Jersey, New Mexico and Washington, D.C., have nearly eliminated cash bail or limited its use. Many include exceptions for high-level crimes.

Proponents of eliminating cash bail describe it as a penalty on poverty, suggesting that the wealthy can pay their way out of jail to await trial while those with fewer financial resources have to sit it out behind bars. Critics have argued that bail is a time-honored way to ensure defendants released from jail show up for court proceedings. They warn that violent criminals will be released pending trial, giving them license to commit other crimes.

A lack of consensus

Studies have shown mixed results regarding the impact of cashless bail on crime. Many focus on the recidivism of individual defendants rather than overall crime rates.

A 2024 report published by the Brennan Center for Justice saw “no statistically significant relationship” between bail reform and crime rates. It looked at crime rate data from 2015 through 2021 for 33 cities across the U.S., 22 of which had instituted some type of bail reform. Researchers used a statistical method to determine if crime rates had diverged in those with reforms and those without.

Ames Grawert, the report’s co-author and senior counsel in the Brennan Center’s Justice Program, said this conclusion “holds true for trends in crime overall or specifically violent crime.”

Similarly, a 2023 paper published in the American Economic Journal found no evidence that cash bail helps ensure defendants will show up in court or prevents crime among those who are released while awaiting trial. The paper evaluated the impact of a 2018 policy instituted by the Philadelphia’s district attorney that instructed prosecutors not to set bail for certain offenses.

A 2019 court decree in Harris County, Texas, requires most people charged with a misdemeanor to be released without bail while awaiting trial. The latest report from the monitoring team responsible for tracking the impact of this decision, released in 2024, notes that the number of people arrested for misdemeanors has declined by more than 15% since 2015. The number of those rearrested within one year has similarly declined, with rearrest rates remaining stable in recent years.

Asked what data Trump was using to support his claim, the White House pointed to a 2022 report from the district attorney’s office in Yolo County, California, that looked at how a temporary cashless bail system implemented across the state to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in courts and jails impacted recidivism. It found that out of 595 individuals released between April 2020 and May 2021 under this system, 70.6% were arrested again after they were released. A little more than half were rearrested more than once.

A more recent paper, published in February by the IZA Institute of Labor Economics, also explored the effects of California’s decision to suspend most bail during the COVID-19 pandemic. It reports that implementation of this policy “caused notable increases in both the likelihood and number of rearrests within 30 days.” However, a return to cash bail did not impact the number of rearrests for any type of offense. The paper acknowledges that other factors, such as societal disruption from the pandemic, could have contributed to the initial increase.

Many contributing factors

It is difficult to pinpoint specific explanations for why crime rises and falls.

The American Bail Coalition’s Clayton noted that other policies that have had a negative impact on crime, implemented concurrently with bail reforms, make it “difficult to isolate or elevate one or more causes over the others.”

Paul Heaton, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies criminal justice interventions, had a similar outlook.

“Certainly there are some policy levers that people look at — the size of the police force and certain policies around sentencing,” he said. “But there’s a lot of variation in crime that I think even criminologists don’t necessarily fully understand.”

Trump's approval rating fell 10% since taking office in January, which includes a 17% decline among independents to 29%, matching his all-time lowest rating among the group. The president was, however, reported to have steady support among Republicans at 89%, while support among Democrats was consistently reported to be in the lower single digits, having dropped to 1% in June before increasing to 2% in July.

The poll was conducted between July 7 and July 21, days after Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' was signed into law on Independence Day (July 4). The president's handling of key foreign and domestic issues were also reported to have low approval ratings including his handling of the situation in Iran (42%), foreign affairs (41%), immigration (38%), the economy (37%), the Israel-Palestine conflict (36%), foreign trade (36%), the Russia-Ukraine war (33%) and the federal budget (29%).

Trump was also reported to be losing support among male voters, according to the latest CBS News/YouGov poll released last week. Trump was reported to have a -6 net approval rating among men, with a 47% approval rating and a 53% disapproval rating, the highest of any point during his second term in office.

The president began his current term at a +20 margin, with a 60% approval rating and 40% disapproval rating among male voters. Additionally, men supported Trump by a wider margin in his 2024 presidential election victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris than in his 2020 loss to former President Joe Biden, having narrowly won men under the age of 50, a group that had previously favored Biden by 10 points, according to PewResearch.org.

Trump's shift among male voters has been consistent since April, with his approval rating dropping from 58% to 49% and his disapproval rating rising from 42% to 51% on April 11. Polling expert Nate Silver claimed that the president's approval rating has reportedly ""started to drop more quickly"" in the latest edition of his Silver Bulletin Substack released last Tuesday (July 22).

Trump's net approval rating is currently at -8.9, which is a drop of -2.0 points in one week and only 0.8 points higher than the -9.7 net approval low point of his second term reported on April 29, but still about seven points higher than the same point of his first term, according to Silver. The president has reportedly seen a decrease in support for several policies including immigration (-3.4 to -7.4), economy (-12.1 to -14.1), trade (-14.5 to -17.5) and inflation (-24.5 to -24.8).

Additionally, the percentage of Americans who strongly approve of Trump's job performance has dropped below 27% for the first time during his second term with about 43% of respondents claiming they strongly disapprove of him."

(WASHINGTON) -- Roy Cooper, the former Democratic governor of North Carolina, officially launched his Senate bid for Republican Sen. Thom Tillis' open seat in 2026 on Monday.

“I'm Roy Cooper, and I know that today, for too many Americans, the middle class feels like a distant dream. Meanwhile, the biggest corporations and the richest Americans have grabbed unimaginable wealth at your expense. It's time for that to change,” Cooper said in an announcement video posted on X.

In his announcement, Cooper said he believes that the next election will determine “if we even have a middle class in America anymore.” He doesn’t mention President Donald Trump directly.

“Right now, our country is facing a moment as fragile as any I can remember, and the decisions we make in the next election will determine if we even have a middle class in America anymore. I never really wanted to go to Washington. I just wanted to serve the people of North Carolina, right here where I've lived all my life. But these are not ordinary times. Politicians in D.C. are running up our debt, ripping away our health care, disrespecting our veterans, cutting health for the poor, and even putting Medicare and Social Security at risk just to give tax breaks to billionaires. That's wrong, and I've had enough.”

The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) responded to the news in a statement slamming Cooper as both ""far left"" and anti-Trump, alongside attempting to tie him to former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris.

“Roy Cooper is a Democrat lapdog who spent his time as Governor sabotaging President Trump, doing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' bidding,” NRSC Communications Director Joanna Rodriguez said partly in a statement. “When Hurricane Helene hit, Cooper's gross mismanagement left over 100 North Carolinians dead and an estimated $53 billion in damage to businesses, homes, and infrastructure. North Carolina wants a senator who will champion working families, safety, and American values, not an incompetent, far-left career politician like Cooper who will wreck everything they care about.”

As for the Republicans’ pick, multiple sources tell ABC News that RNC Chair Michael Whatley is planning to launch a bid after being asked directly by Trump to run. Trump is hopeful that Whatley, who led the North Carolina Republican Party before becoming RNC chair, has the knowledge of the state, the national profile and the network of relationships to run a strong campaign.

Tillis said in June that he would not seek reelection, citing “the political theatre and partisan gridlock in Washington” and as Trump railed against him for opposing his signature megabill.

Over the weekend, Trump claimed that Beyoncé broke the law after allegedly getting paid $11 million to appear at a Houston rally for Harris in October 2024.

This isn't the first time Bey has been accused of receiving eight figures to endorse the Democratic candidate. Last year, Trump supporters circulated rumors that Harris' campaign had paid Beyoncé $10 million for her rally appearance.

However, there is no basis or evidence to support any of these claims. Federal campaign records show Harris' campaign paid Beyoncé’s production company $165,000, a payment that was listed as a ""campaign event production"" expense. A Harris campaign spokesperson said last year that they didn't pay for celebrity endorsements, but they were required by law to cover costs connected to their event appearances.

The White House has yet to provide evidence of Trump's $11 million payment claim. When the president referred to the alleged eight-figure payment last year, Trump simply said: “Somebody just showed me something. They gave her $11 million.”

Amid Trump's latest comments, a Harris spokesperson cited remarks from Beyoncé’s mother, Tina Knowles, who said in November that the $10 million payment was a “lie."" Knowles also noted that the claim was taken down by Instagram as “False Information.” A spokesperson for Beyoncé also previously stated that the allegation was “beyond ridiculous.”

Trump on Sunday (July 27) also criticized other payments from the Harris campaign to organizations connected to prominent endorsers.

Here’s a question: Is the Trump administration taking conspiracy distraction pitches?

Seriously, has the White House considered including on its website a link to offer suggestions for President Donald Trump’s next transparently desperate attempt at turning people’s attention away from the Jeffrey Epstein files debacle and whatever other aspects of his abysmal presidency that he wants flying under our collective radar?

A week ago, Trump’s Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was out here suggesting that President Barack Obama should be prosecuted for “treason” for attempting a “coup” on Trump based on emails that revealed Obama knew Russia hadn’t manipulated the vote count during the 2016 election — which is an allegation neither Obama or any of the reports confirming Russian officials attempt to influence the election, including a 2020 bipartisan Senate report confirmed by then-Republican Senate Intelligence Committee leader Marco Rubio. (You know, that guy who is currently Trump’s Secretary of State.) Trump celebrated this non-bombshell of a non-scandal by posting an AI-generated video showing Obama being arrested for this non-crime, but now that this non-troversy is falling flat, he needs a new target.

So, now Trump is out here talking about prosecuting Beyoncé.

Actually, he’s not just after Beyoncé. Trump wants to slap handcuffs on Al Sharpton, Oprah Winfrey and, for a little MAGA razzle-dazzle, former Vice President Kamala Harris.

“I’m looking at the large amount of money owed by the Democrats, after the Presidential Election, and the fact that they admit to paying, probably illegally, Eleven Million Dollars to singer Beyoncé for an ENDORSEMENT (she never sang, not one note, and left the stage to a booing and angry audience!), Three Million Dollars for ‘expenses,’ to Oprah, Six Hundred Thousand Dollars to very low rated TV ‘anchor,’ Al Sharpton (a total lightweight!), and others to be named for doing, absolutely NOTHING!” Trump wrote Saturday in yet another unhinged Truth Social post that reveals he has the media literacy of a wet mop and the legal understanding of a wet mop with 34 felonies.

“These ridiculous fees were incorrectly stated in the books and records. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PAY FOR AN ENDORSEMENT. IT IS TOTALLY ILLEGAL TO DO SO. Can you imagine what would happen if politicians started paying for people to endorse them,” he continued. “All hell would break out! Kamala, and all of those that received Endorsement money, BROKE THE LAW. They should all be prosecuted! Thank you for your attention to this matter.”

You might be wondering where Trump is getting this “Eleven Million” figure from — or any of his numbers for that matter. Well, if I had to take a guess, I’d say he got his numbers from the same database he gets his (fictional) crime rate figures from, or the same reports where he found his evidence that the 2020 election was rigged against him, or the vetted information that “they are eating the dogs…they’re eating the cats.”

The archive of Trump’s demented imagination might be scary, but it has been a near-bottomless source of MAGA misinformation and fodder for MAGA minions who conveniently don’t know anything about how anything works — just like their MAGA messiah. Only now, it appears that Trump is running out of material and scraping the bottom of his barrel of alternative facts pulled directly out of his rust-tinted hind parts.

From CNN:

Federal campaign spending records show a $165,000 payment from the Harris campaign to Beyoncé’s production company, which the campaign listed as a “campaign event production” expense. A Harris campaign spokesperson told Deadline last year that they didn’t pay celebrity endorsers, but were required by law to cover the costs connected to their appearances. Regardless of the merits of this particular $165,000 expenditure, it’s far from an $11 million one. Nobody has ever produced any evidence for the claim of an eight-figure endorsement payment to Beyoncé since the claim that it was “$10 million” began spreading last year among Trump supporters on social media. Fact-check websites FactCheck.org and PolitiFact looked into the “$10 million” claim during the campaign and did not find any basis for it. The White House did not immediately respond to a CNN request late Saturday for any evidence of Trump’s $11 million figure. When Trump previously invoked the baseless figure, during an interview in February, he described his source in the vaguest of terms: “Somebody just showed me something. They gave her $11 million.”

Records also show Oprah’s production company, Harpo Productions, was paid $1 million for a livestream event she helped organize in Michigan for Harris, and Harris’ team also sent $500,000 to Sharpton’s National Action Network, but there are no existing records that come close to confirming the figures cited (or non-cited) by Trump.

Honestly, even if Trump wasn’t outright lying, which he is, the commander in quid pro quo would still be a hypocrite who seems to be completely forgetting that he staged a whole Tesla infomercial in front of the White House to help out his ex-bosom buddy, Elon Musk.

Anyway, Trump needs help finding new deflections. Hell, I’m not sure if the commander in clear cognitive decline even remembers that, in May, he had already called for an investigation into Oprah and Queen Bee over their support for Harris and imaginary payments the former presidential candidate made to them and other recording artists.

The Epstein thing just isn’t going away as fast as Trump’s ability to discern facts and reality, or his ability to come up with fresh distractions. Not that crowd sourcing would likely help him any, but, damn, his administration is full of woefully unqualified MAGA dummies who don’t seem to have any other ideas, so it’s worth a try.

His chance came two years ago when he bought a one-way ticket to Kenya.

The 38-year-old retired veteran has found a community in the east African country's capital, where he now runs an Airbnb business. He loves admiring Nairobi's golden sunset from a rooftop terrace, and enjoys a luxurious lifestyle in a tastefully furnished apartment in an upmarket neighborhood.

Harris is part of a growing wave of African Americans who are relocating to Kenya, citing the need to connect with their ancestors — or ""coming home,"" a phrase often used among the Black community.

Like dozens of other African Americans who have moved to Nairobi in recent years, Harris was attracted to Kenya's tropical climate and what he describes as the warmth and friendliness of the people he believes he shares a history and culture with.

In search of community and a better life

""I have always had that adventurous spirit, especially when I joined the military and got to go to different countries. So I am taking the opportunity to venture out to new places,"" he said. ""That is what allowed me to make a home away from home and Kenya is my new home.""

Some friends have been reaching out to him to explore a ""change from the U.S for their peace of mind,"" he said.

Several other African Americans who have ""come home"" like him have set up thriving businesses in Nairobi that include travel agencies, restaurants and farms.

Many African Americans who have sought a better life abroad or are considering it said President Donald Trump's administration — with its crackdown on diversity programs — isn't the main reason they want to move.

Rather, most say they had been mulling a move for some time, and the current political environment in the U.S. may be pushing them to act sooner than initially planned.

""I can't say the administration is the reason why the people I know want to part ways from America. Some are planning to move for a better quality of living life,"" Harris said.

Auston Holleman, an American YouTuber who has lived in various countries for almost a decade, said he settled on Kenya nine months ago because people ""look like me.""

""It is not like going to Europe or going to some Latin American countries where there are not many Black people,"" he said.

Holleman, who often films his daily life, said he felt that the social fabric in the U.S. was ""broken."" In contrast, he said he felt socially accepted in Kenya. He cited an experience when his taxi driver's car stopped, and in five minutes they got help from a random stranger.

""That made me realize I was in the right place,"" he said.

Growing numbers are interested in leaving the US

Other African countries have attracted even larger numbers of African Americans. Ghana, which launched a ""Year of the Return"" program to attract the Black diaspora in 2019, said last year it held a ceremony that granted citizenship to 524 people, mostly Black Americans.

African American businesses such as Adilah Relocation Services have seen a notable rise in the number of African Americans seeking to move to Kenya.

The company's founder, Adilah Mohammad, moved to Kenya four days after her mother's funeral in search of healing.

She says the peace and restoration she experienced in Kenya made her stay — and advocate for those searching for the same. Her company helps clients relocate by house hunting, shopping for furniture and ensuring banking and medical services are seamless.

""There are 15 families that have come so far, and we have five more on the calendar that are coming in the next 90 days. We have people that have booked for 2026 with no date, they just know that they are leaving,"" she says.

Mohammad said many African Americans have been planning their move for decades.

""For me it is a movement. It is people deciding to make a choice for themselves, they are not being forced, shackles are being broken. When they say they are coming home, they are choosing to be free and it is mental freedom and so I am ecstatic,"" she says.

Experts say African economies are likely to benefit from these moves, especially from those willing to tackle corruption and create a healthy environment for investors.

Raphael Obonyo, a public policy expert at U.N-Habitat, says the U.S is losing resources — as well as the popular narrative that America is the land of opportunities and dreams.

""This reverse migration is denting that narrative, so America is most likely to lose including things like brain drain,"" he explained.

For Mohammad, the sense of belonging has given her peace within.

""I love being here. Returning to Africa is one thing, but finding the place that you feel like you belong is another,"" she said."

This year, two off-year gubernatorial contests, in Virginia and New Jersey, give Democrats an opportunity to create momentum if they can win both elections.

New Jersey

The race for governor of the Garden State pits Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill against former GOP Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli.

Sherrill graduated from the Naval Academy and spent almost a decade on active duty as a helicopter pilot. She holds a master’s degree from the London School of Economics and a law degree from Georgetown. She subsequently served as an assistant U.S. attorney.

Sherrill won a U.S. House seat in 2018 and was elected three more times before deciding to run for governor.

The congresswoman was one of a half-dozen serious Democratic contenders for governor, including another member of Congress, two high-profile mayors and the former president of the New Jersey Senate.

Sherrill has an independent streak. She was the seventh member of the House to call for President Joe Biden to exit from the 2024 presidential contest, and on two occasions she didn’t vote for Nancy Pelosi as speaker.

Ciattarelli, a graduate of Seton Hall University, is a businessman who was elected to the Somerset County Freeholder Board and to the State Assembly. In 2021, he ran a very competitive but unsuccessful race for governor, losing by just 3 points to incumbent Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, 51 percent to 48 percent.

The Garden State Matchup

Ciattarelli never stopped running after his 2021 loss, and he deserves to be taken seriously, notwithstanding the mid-June Rutgers/Eagleton poll that showed the Democrat with a clear advantage.

As New Jersey columnist Tom Martello wrote recently:

“Mikie Sherrill by a landslide? Nobody believes that will be the result of New Jersey’s piping hot governor’s race come November. Not the Republicans. Not the Democrats. Not the campaigns. And not the Rutgers-Eagleton pollster who last week released a survey that says Sherrill has an early 20-point lead over Republican Jack Ciattarelli. No, this puppy isn’t over before it started.”

In another column, Martello wrote, “Eight years of rule by one party almost invariably follows eight years of rule by the other,” and that gives Republicans a shot of optimism.

But if some political trends favor the Republican nominee, other dynamics favor Sherrill. She could benefit from the electorate’s dissatisfaction with Trump.

“President Donald Trump looms large over the race: 52% of voters say he is a ‘major factor’ in their vote for governor and another 18% say he is a ‘minor’ one, while 30% say he isn’t a factor at all,” Ashley Konig, the director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest polling at Rutgers University-New Brunswick, said of the June poll.

Ciattarelli’s current campaign website does not mention Donald Trump or MAGA, but the president will be a liability for Republicans in the fall election, if only because the White House has polarized the country and Trump could impact Republican turnout in the fall.

Sherrill is a personable, smart contender whose record is likely to appeal to Democratic and swing voters, and Trump’s agenda and language likely won’t help Ciattarelli.

Virginia

The race for Virginia governor pits the state’s GOP lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, against former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger.

Earle-Sears won her current office four years ago, when Republican Glenn Youngkin was elected governor and the GOP swept all three statewide races. Youngkin is prohibited from serving consecutive terms.

A businesswoman who served in the Marines, Earle-Sears served a single term in the Virginia House of Delegates from 2002 to 2004 but was less successful in 2004 (when she lost a bid for Congress) and 2018 (when she got clobbered as a write-in Senate hopeful).

Earle-Sears supported Trump in 2020 and 2024, and in 2020 she was national chairwoman of “Black Americans to Re-elect the President.”

Spanberger graduated from the University of Virginia, earned an MBA from Purdue and joined the Central Intelligence Agency in 2006. She was first elected to Congress in 2018 and had tight contests in all her House races.

The congresswoman did not vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker in 2019, and she is more of a moderate than a passionate progressive.

The Bottom Lines

Biden carried Virginia by 10 points in 2020, while Kamala Harris carried it by 5 points in 2024. Hillary Clinton also won Virginia in 2016.

The state is competitive, but Democrats have a narrow advantage because of the growth of the Washington, D.C., suburbs.

New Jersey is less competitive. Harris carried New Jersey by 6 points in 2024, while Biden carried it by 16 points in 2020 and Clinton carried it by 14 points in 2016.

Republicans will try to “localize” both states, thereby minimizing the influence of Trump. But that will be difficult to do, considering the president’s personality and his increasingly poor job performance numbers among political independents.

Both races merit watching, but the national dynamics give advantages to Sherrill and Spanberger."

Trump's approval rating fell 10% since taking office in January, which includes a 17% decline among independents to 29%, matching his all-time lowest rating among the group. The president was, however, reported to have steady support among Republicans at 89%, while support among Democrats was consistently reported to be in the lower single digits, having dropped to 1% in June before increasing to 2% in July.

The poll was conducted between July 7 and July 21, days after Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' was signed into law on Independence Day (July 4). The president's handling of key foreign and domestic issues were also reported to have low approval ratings including his handling of the situation in Iran (42%), foreign affairs (41%), immigration (38%), the economy (37%), the Israel-Palestine conflict (36%), foreign trade (36%), the Russia-Ukraine war (33%) and the federal budget (29%).

Trump was also reported to be losing support among male voters, according to the latest CBS News/YouGov poll released last week. Trump was reported to have a -6 net approval rating among men, with a 47% approval rating and a 53% disapproval rating, the highest of any point during his second term in office.

The president began his current term at a +20 margin, with a 60% approval rating and 40% disapproval rating among male voters. Additionally, men supported Trump by a wider margin in his 2024 presidential election victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris than in his 2020 loss to former President Joe Biden, having narrowly won men under the age of 50, a group that had previously favored Biden by 10 points, according to PewResearch.org.

Trump's shift among male voters has been consistent since April, with his approval rating dropping from 58% to 49% and his disapproval rating rising from 42% to 51% on April 11. Polling expert Nate Silver claimed that the president's approval rating has reportedly ""started to drop more quickly"" in the latest edition of his Silver Bulletin Substack released last Tuesday (July 22).

Trump's net approval rating is currently at -8.9, which is a drop of -2.0 points in one week and only 0.8 points higher than the -9.7 net approval low point of his second term reported on April 29, but still about seven points higher than the same point of his first term, according to Silver. The president has reportedly seen a decrease in support for several policies including immigration (-3.4 to -7.4), economy (-12.1 to -14.1), trade (-14.5 to -17.5) and inflation (-24.5 to -24.8).

Additionally, the percentage of Americans who strongly approve of Trump's job performance has dropped below 27% for the first time during his second term with about 43% of respondents claiming they strongly disapprove of him."

Trump's net approval rating is currently at -8.9, which is a drop of -2.0 points in one week and only 0.8 points higher than the -9.7 net approval low point of his second term reported on April 29, but still about seven points higher than the same point of his first term, according to Silver. The president has reportedly seen a decrease in support for several policies including immigration (-3.4 to -7.4), economy (-12.1 to -14.1), trade (-14.5 to -17.5) and inflation (-24.5 to -24.8).

Additionally, the percentage of Americans who strongly approve of Trump's job performance has dropped below 27% for the first time during his second term with about 43% of respondents claiming they strongly disapprove of him."
https://wcbm.com/national-headline/early-analysis-do-republicans-have-a-decent-shot-at-defying-history-in-the-midterms/,,Early Analysis : Do Republicans Have a Decent Shot at Defying History in the Midterms ? ,20250728T181500Z,https://wcbm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/0ea63dd6-1082-4ea7-89e8-05eaad82d9ce.jpg,wcbm.com,English,United States,"If history is any guide, Democrats should enter next fall’s midterm election cycle with a distinct advantage. Generally, the opposition party fares well in these contests — sometimes very well. Looking back over the past two decades, for instance, four of the last five midterm cycles have resulted in waves (blue in 2006, 2018; red in 2010 and 2014). But in 2022, Democrats over-performed expectations and held the GOP to a ‘red trickle,’ which was still sufficient for Republicans to take back the House, but just barely. Given the tiny margins in both Congressional chambers right now, even a similar trickle next year would probably be enough to hand Democrats the gavel in at least the House of Representatives. This is especially true, in light of Democrats’ recently-established and -demonstrated structural advantage in lower-turnout elections. Their base shows up, faithfully. Republicans have started to rely more heavily on lower-propensity voters to win, which presents a challenging proposition in non-‘Super Bowl’ presidential years.

That said, there are some extremely early indications that 2026 isn’t shaping up like either 2006 or 2018. We’ve written about a few of them recently, including some heartening numbers in the chase for dollars:

Another good indicator that this is not 2017/2018. Republicans are out-raising Democrats and Democrats’ party approval and enthusiasm is still abysmal. https://t.co/SkCB9yIp6v — Matt Whitlock (@mattdizwhitlock) July 14, 2025

There’s also this way-too-early (but perhaps still somewhat useful on trend-spotting) polling analysis that made the rounds a few weeks ago:

Reality check: Dems are way behind their 2006 & 2018 pace on the generic ballot at this point in the cycle. Ahead by only 2 pt vs. 7 pt in 2006/2018 cycles. Seat-by-seat analysis actually reveals more GOP pickup opportunities than Dems! Very much unlike 2006 & 2018 at this pt. pic.twitter.com/CRgXukTjz6 — (((Harry Enten))) (@ForecasterEnten) July 16, 2025

NBC’s data guru also sees some major distinctions between terrible bloodbath years for Republicans and what appears to be brewing in 2026:

NBC News National Political Correspondent Steve Kornacki joins Meet the Press NOW to explain how Republicans could hold on to control of the House in the 2026 midterm elections compared to their sweeping losses in 2018. https://t.co/xrLg2gpnbb pic.twitter.com/IAN7UCM2AL — Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) July 23, 2025

“The makeup of that Republican majority that got decimated in 2018 [net 40 seats lost] is very different than the makeup of the Republican majority right now,” Kornacki told viewers, explaining that many more House Republicans in that previous cycle represented districts carried by Hillary Clinton in 2016 (25 seats in 2018), compared to those who hold seats in Harris-won seats today (just three seats). “Republicans have fewer overall seats now, but there are more Republicans in truly safe ‘Trump landslide’ districts,” he said of the 2026 map. He also noted that if the red states of Texas and Ohio go through a redistricting process to draw Democrats out of seats, that could blunt some of the built-in Democratic advantages in the upcoming midterms, potentially keeping them “in the game to hold onto their majority.” Democrats are screaming about the unfairness of gerrymandering, but they are ruthless gerrymanderers themselves. Part of the reason the New York Times writes that Democrats have few options on the table to counter potential GOP redistricting plans is that they’ve already squeezed every ounce of their advantage in some of the bluest states they control:

But the toolbox for Democrats is relatively sparse, aside from litigation or legislative protests. Though Democratic leaders have indicated a willingness to go tit for tat with Republicans, most of the largest blue states do not have a partisan redistricting process akin to the one in Texas…States where Democrats would have complete control over any redistricting, such as Illinois and Maryland, are already gerrymandered heavily in their favor. Squeezing more Democratic seats out of those states would be a challenge…While Democrats have their share of aggressive gerrymanders, blue states have led in embracing reforms to insulate redistricting from politics, such as creating an independent or bipartisan commission to agree on new maps. Such actions — done in the name of good governance and often with significant support from voters — are now leaving Democrats in a bind.

Democrats have tied their own hands for their own political reasons in some places, while aggressively gerrymandering elsewhere. They like to pretend that Republicans are the scheming, power-hungry party, and just whistle past glaring examples like these:

Republicans win 40% of the votes for US House in CA, yet hold only 17% of House seats in the state. Newsom wants an unconstitutional ultra gerrymander because Democrats’ massive overrepresentation in our House delegation is not enough for him, Mr. Democracy. — Ron Nehring (@RonNehring) July 23, 2025

Republicans average 41% of the vote in California. Yet Newsom wants to re-draw congressional districts so we have 6% of the seats. His scheme involves tricking Californians to abolish the nonpartisan line-drawing commission. “America’s Most Corrupt Governor” is an understatement. https://t.co/L4D6um3Ync — Kevin Kiley (@KevinKileyCA) July 19, 2025

As usual, Democrats love gerrymandering and unfair maps as long as those schemes benefit their party. When the tables are turned, it’s “anti-democracy” and “authoritarianism.” Funny how that works. If President Trump can help the party navigate primary season ahead of the 2026 general, thus avoiding bloody and ugly internecine nominating fights, that could also be rather helpful and a refreshing course correction. Politico reports that’s exactly the plan. Of course, a massive factor in 2026 will be how the national mood looks around this time next year. That’s unknowable. As of this moment, though, some of Trump’s approval numbers, and overall economic sentiment is heading in the right direction for Republicans:

Trump's approval rating fell 10% since taking office in January, which includes a 17% decline among independents to 29%, matching his all-time lowest rating among the group. The president was, however, reported to have steady support among Republicans at 89%, while support among Democrats was consistently reported to be in the lower single digits, having dropped to 1% in June before increasing to 2% in July.

The poll was conducted between July 7 and July 21, days after Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' was signed into law on Independence Day (July 4). The president's handling of key foreign and domestic issues were also reported to have low approval ratings including his handling of the situation in Iran (42%), foreign affairs (41%), immigration (38%), the economy (37%), the Israel-Palestine conflict (36%), foreign trade (36%), the Russia-Ukraine war (33%) and the federal budget (29%).

Trump was also reported to be losing support among male voters, according to the latest CBS News/YouGov poll released last week. Trump was reported to have a -6 net approval rating among men, with a 47% approval rating and a 53% disapproval rating, the highest of any point during his second term in office.

The president began his current term at a +20 margin, with a 60% approval rating and 40% disapproval rating among male voters. Additionally, men supported Trump by a wider margin in his 2024 presidential election victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris than in his 2020 loss to former President Joe Biden, having narrowly won men under the age of 50, a group that had previously favored Biden by 10 points, according to PewResearch.org.

The president began his current term at a +20 margin, with a 60% approval rating and 40% disapproval rating among male voters. Additionally, men supported Trump by a wider margin in his 2024 presidential election victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris than in his 2020 loss to former President Joe Biden, having narrowly won men under the age of 50, a group that had previously favored Biden by 10 points, according to PewResearch.org.

Trump's shift among male voters has been consistent since April, with his approval rating dropping from 58% to 49% and his disapproval rating rising from 42% to 51% on April 11. Polling expert Nate Silver claimed that the president's approval rating has reportedly ""started to drop more quickly"" in the latest edition of his Silver Bulletin Substack released last Tuesday (July 22).

Trump's net approval rating is currently at -8.9, which is a drop of -2.0 points in one week and only 0.8 points higher than the -9.7 net approval low point of his second term reported on April 29, but still about seven points higher than the same point of his first term, according to Silver. The president has reportedly seen a decrease in support for several policies including immigration (-3.4 to -7.4), economy (-12.1 to -14.1), trade (-14.5 to -17.5) and inflation (-24.5 to -24.8).

Additionally, the percentage of Americans who strongly approve of Trump's job performance has dropped below 27% for the first time during his second term with about 43% of respondents claiming they strongly disapprove of him."

Over the weekend, Trump claimed that Beyoncé broke the law after allegedly getting paid $11 million to appear at a Houston rally for Harris in October 2024.

This isn't the first time Bey has been accused of receiving eight figures to endorse the Democratic candidate. Last year, Trump supporters circulated rumors that Harris' campaign had paid Beyoncé $10 million for her rally appearance.

However, there is no basis or evidence to support any of these claims. Federal campaign records show Harris' campaign paid Beyoncé’s production company $165,000, a payment that was listed as a ""campaign event production"" expense. A Harris campaign spokesperson said last year that they didn't pay for celebrity endorsements, but they were required by law to cover costs connected to their event appearances.

The White House has yet to provide evidence of Trump's $11 million payment claim. When the president referred to the alleged eight-figure payment last year, Trump simply said: “Somebody just showed me something. They gave her $11 million.”

Amid Trump's latest comments, a Harris spokesperson cited remarks from Beyoncé’s mother, Tina Knowles, who said in November that the $10 million payment was a “lie."" Knowles also noted that the claim was taken down by Instagram as “False Information.” A spokesperson for Beyoncé also previously stated that the allegation was “beyond ridiculous.”

Trump on Sunday (July 27) also criticized other payments from the Harris campaign to organizations connected to prominent endorsers.

It is unclear what title Greenstein will have, but sources say his role will not be limited to motion pictures.

Greenstein was most recently president of Sony Motion Picture Group, a role he shared with Sanford Panitch. It is unclear if he will be replaced.

Greenstein will be part of a leadership team that includes Cindy Holland, the former Netflix TV chief who will help oversee streaming strategy at the new Paramount, as well as Dana Goldberg, Skydance’s chief creative officer. George Cheeks, co-CEO of Paramount Global and CEO of CBS, will remain at the company post-merger. David Ellison, Skydance’s CEO, will become chairman and CEO of Paramount after orchestrating the deal.

Brian Robbins, who led the film studio since 2021 and served as Paramount’s co-CEO since 2024, is expected to leave the company. Chris McCarthy, head of Showtime & MTV Entertainment Studios and Paramount Media Networks, who also served as co-CEO of Paramount Global with Robbins and Cheeks, will depart.

Popular on Variety

Skydance has not announced the executive leadership structure or its reorganization plans.

Greenstein joined Sony in 2014, having been hired away from Paramount to serve as the studio’s head of worldwide marketing and distribution. At Sony, Greenstein led the marketing campaigns for the studio’s blockbuster “Spider-Man” and “Jumanji” franchises. He was hired by Amy Pascal and continued to oversee the studio’s marketing under Tom Rothman, who succeeded Pascal in 2015. At Sony, some of the films he worked on include “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” “Uncharted,” “Little Women,” “28 Years Later” and “Paddington in Peru.”

Greenstein worked at Paramount since 2005, serving as its chief marketing officer and as executive vice president of creative advertising. Before joining Paramount, he served as head of marketing for Dimension Films.

The $8 billion merger of Skydance and Paramount Global has languished for months, awaiting government approval. Last week, the FCC signed off on the deal, an endorsement that came after Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to President Trump to settle his lawsuit against CBS over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris.

At Paramount, Greenstein will join a company that controls several major franchises, such as “Sonic the Hedgehog,” “SpongeBob SquarePants” and “Star Trek,” but also a studio that has struggled to keep up with the competition as it has endured several corporate leadership shifts and a succession drama involving the Redstone family.

Spokespeople for Skydance and Sony declined to comment."
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/sharpton-trump-claim-paid-endorse-150812876.html,,Sharpton on Trump claim he was paid to endorse Harris :  Absolutely not  ,20250728T171500Z,https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_hill_articles_341/da1494cd47404c998eed287d66214739,yahoo.com,English,United States,"The Rev. Al Sharpton early Monday pushed back on President Trump’s claim that he was paid to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris’s 2024 presidential bid, saying he neither received money from the campaign nor formally endorsed the Democratic ticket.

“Absolutely not,” Sharpton said in an interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” when asked if he was paid to endorse Harris.

Sharpton noted that his nonprofit, the National Action Network (NAN), received donations from the campaign, which Sharpton said is public information included in Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings.

But, he added, “National Action Network nor I even endorsed her.”

Sharpton said NAN’s lawyers are looking at whether they can file a defamation lawsuit against Trump, noting the president has levied the accusation against Sharpton in the past.

“He had knowledge this time that there was no endorsement and that I didn’t get any money. This went to the nonprofit that I’m connected to,” Sharpton said.

Over the weekend, Trump claimed Sharpton received $600,000 for endorsing Harris in 2024, saying, “YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PAY FOR AN ENDORSEMENT. IT IS TOTALLY ILLEGAL TO DO SO.”

“Can you imagine what would happen if politicians started paying for people to endorse them. All hell would break out! Kamala, and all of those that received Endorsement money, BROKE THE LAW. They should all be prosecuted! Thank you for your attention to this matter,” Trump continued.

Sharpton said on MSNBC that Trump made the claim because he had “very serious problems” with his base’s frustration over his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. Sharpton suggested the president’s latest accusation is an effort to distract from Epstein.

“So last week, he was trying to flood the zone to take any pressure off of him and try to put his MAGA base back together again,” Sharpton said.

“It’s all about trying to get past Epstein,” he added. “We have shown in National Action Network and other groups what we did and didn’t do in the campaign. Even when I spoke at the convention, I said, we don’t endorse candidates. We have come with our files, release the Epstein files. Mr. Trump, do what we did or be quiet.”

Knowles also noted that the claim was taken down by Instagram as “False Information.” A spokesperson for Beyoncé also previously stated that the allegation was “beyond ridiculous.”

Trump on Sunday (July 27) also criticized other payments from the Harris campaign to organizations connected to prominent endorsers.

Roy Cooper will run for the U.S. Senate in North Carolina, giving Democrats a proven statewide winner in an open-seat race that is expected to be one of the most competitive 2026 contests

RALEIGH, N.C. -- RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper will run for the U.S. Senate in North Carolina, giving Democrats a proven statewide winner in an open-seat race that is expected to be one of the most competitive 2026 contests.

Cooper made the announcement Monday with a video released on social media and his campaign website. The former two-term governor will immediately become the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in the race to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Thom Tillis.

Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley plans to run for the GOP nomination, with President Donald Trump's blessing, according to two people familiar with his thinking who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly before an official announcement.

Whatley, the former North Carolina GOP chairman, received Trump's endorsement after the president's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, passed on the seat.

Cooper's candidacy is a big recruiting win for Democrats, who see the open seat as a top pick-up opportunity in what will be a challenging year. To retake the majority in 2026, Democrats need to net four seats, and most of the contests are in states that Trump easily won last year. Trump won North Carolina by about 3 percentage points, one of his closest margins of victory.

Trump endorsed Whatley on his Truth Social platform Thursday night, posting that should he run, “Mike would make an unbelievable Senator from North Carolina.”

Ex-U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel already has been campaigning for the Democratic nomination for months. Party primaries would be March 3.

Cooper, 68, has been on statewide ballots going back a quarter-century — serving 16 years previously as attorney general before being first elected governor in 2016.

With a political career going back nearly 40 years, Cooper has had a knack for winning in a state where the legislature and appeals courts are now dominated by Republicans. State law barred Cooper from seeking a third consecutive gubernatorial term. He spent the spring on a teaching gig at Harvard.

State and national Democrats were longing for Cooper to join the race well before Tillis announced June 29 that he would not seek a third term. That news came after Trump threatened to back a primary candidate against him as Tillis opposed Medicaid reductions in the president’s tax break and spending cut package,

Democrats haven't won a Senate race since 2008 in North Carolina, where independent voters tend to vote Republican in federal elections. Statewide races can be financially exorbitant because there are so many television markets — hundreds of millions of dollars are expected to be spent in the race.

Cooper's recent political history has painted him as a fighter against what he's considered extreme Republican policies, while at times finding consensus with GOP rivals.

When asked by The Associated Press last December about a Senate bid, Cooper replied: “If you’re going to run for public office again, you must have your heart and soul in it, you must have the fire in the belly.""

As governor he steered the state through the coronavirus pandemic, Hurricanes Helene and Florence and a law that became an early flashpoint in the culture wars over access to public restrooms by transgender people. That “bathroom bill” was rolled back early in Cooper's first term, and the state’s economy soared during Cooper’s tenure, marked by big jobs announcements and low unemployment.

While Cooper also managed to get Medicaid expansion approved and a landmark greenhouse gases law enacted, he fell short in stopping legislation that widely expanded private school vouchers and narrowed abortion rights.

Cooper’s perceived accomplishments raised his national profile in 2024, making him as a potential running mate for Kamala Harris until he said it “just wasn’t the right time” for him and for North Carolina.

Republicans have argued that Cooper remains susceptible politically, citing what they consider an extreme record supporting abortion rights and opposing school choice that led to many vetoes.

They've also cited a gubernatorial administration marked by spending overruns at the state Department of Transportation; its response to Helene and delays in rebuilding or renovating homes after Hurricanes Matthew and Florence; and executive orders that restricted businesses and school instruction during COVID-19. As for the roaring economy, Republicans credit themselves through lower taxes and deregulation.

Tillis’ retirement announcement heartened far-right Republicans and strong Trump supporters who have been unhappy for years with his willingness to challenge Trump’s actions and his Cabinet agency choices.

Republicans had deferred to the president’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump, who is a North Carolina native, North Carolina State University graduate and a popular former RNC co-chair with Whatley during the 2024 election campaign. She posted on the social media platform X on Thursday that she would not seek the Senate seat."

Over the weekend, Trump claimed that Beyoncé broke the law after allegedly getting paid $11 million to appear at a Houston rally for Harris in October 2024.

This isn't the first time Bey has been accused of receiving eight figures to endorse the Democratic candidate. Last year, Trump supporters circulated rumors that Harris' campaign had paid Beyoncé $10 million for her rally appearance.

However, there is no basis or evidence to support any of these claims. Federal campaign records show Harris' campaign paid Beyoncé’s production company $165,000, a payment that was listed as a ""campaign event production"" expense. A Harris campaign spokesperson said last year that they didn't pay for celebrity endorsements, but they were required by law to cover costs connected to their event appearances.

https://www.mintpressnews.com/gamaan-iran-polling-regime-change/290306/,,GAMAAN : How Flawed Polling Is Fueling Regime Change in Iran,20250728T171500Z,https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gamaan.png,mintpressnews.com,English,United States,"Editor’s Note | A version of this investigation was originally published by Noir News, an independent investigative outlet covering foreign policy, geopolitics, civil liberties, surveillance, and the Chicago Police Department, among other topics. Authored by researchers Sam Carlen and Iain Carlos, the piece offers a rare, in-depth examination of how the Dutch polling group GAMAAN is shaping Western narratives about Iran through flawed survey methods and ties to U.S.-funded regime-change networks.



MintPress News is publishing this updated edition to help inform ongoing discussions surrounding Iran, public opinion, and the mechanics of soft power. This version includes additional context, recent developments, and editorial updates made in collaboration with the authors.

The Group for Analyzing and Measuring Attitudes in Iran (GAMAAN), an influential Dutch polling group cited by the New York Times, U.S. State Department and U.K. government, claims to capture the true views of everyday Iranians through unconventional online surveys.

GAMAAN calls itself an “independent” research foundation, a label echoed by news outlets and think tanks covering the group’s headline-grabbing findings, which portray the Iranian public as far more secular and anti-government than data from organizations such as Gallup and Pew Research suggest. But GAMAAN’s extensive links to U.S.-funded organizations, many of which advocate for regime change in Iran, and its flawed methodology, have raised serious questions about its credibility and impact on Western understanding of Iran.

“[T]hey know what they think, and they want to use the language of social science to demonstrate that those claims are actually truth. And of course, that’s a problem,” said Daniel Tavana, an assistant professor of political science at Penn State who was a principal investigator for Princeton’s Iran Social Survey.

“[T]hey’re just ideological,” Tavana said.

They are very opposed to the regime, want to embarrass the regime in whatever way they can, and are happy to say … whatever they think will most effectively do that in any given point of time, regardless of whether or not they have evidence for it.”

GAMAAN’s role in anti-government discourse surrounding Iran has taken on heightened significance against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, which culminated in a historic outbreak of hostilities last month.

Ostensibly motivated by concerns over Iran’s nuclear program, the conflict began with an Israeli surprise attack on June 13, to which Iran responded with a barrage of missiles and drones, beginning a days-long cycle of back-and-forth attacks between the two sides.

The U.S. entered the war on June 22, conducting airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, and Iran responded with attacks on U.S. military bases in Qatar. On June 24, a shaky U.S.-brokered ceasefire took hold, and despite initial violations by both Israel and Iran, active hostilities gradually came to a halt.

GAMAAN’s poll results, which portray the Iranian citizenry as far more hostile to their government than other surveys, are often cited by advocates for regime change. The question of Iranians’ support (or lack thereof) for the Islamic Republic was particularly relevant during the hostilities, when doubts arose about the government’s survival, and the prospect of installing the Shah’s son was granted legitimacy by some media outlets.

While Iranian state-owned media have discussed some of GAMAAN’s ties to Western-funded organizations and regime change proponents, as well as the limitations of its survey methods, Noir News is the first to report the full scope of GAMAAN’s numerous connections with U.S. government-funded regime change operatives and the severity of its methodological issues.

Given GAMAAN’s rapid rise to prominence, with its findings often cited by Western governments and prestigious news outlets, the group’s numerous ties to U.S. government-funded supporters of regime change in Iran, and the organization’s dubious survey methods, warrant scrutiny, especially given the anti-Islamic Republic trend of its survey results (with one survey finding 81% of respondents opposed the Islamic Republic), which are used by critics as a cudgel against Iran’s government.

GAMAAN founders Pooyan Tamimi Arab, an assistant professor of religious studies at Utrecht University, and Ammar Maleki, an assistant professor of comparative politics at Tilburg University, are themselves outspoken critics of the Iranian government. Maleki refers to himself as a “pro-democracy activist” and is a vociferous critic of the Islamic Republic and proponent of regime change. Neither responded to requests for comment.

Indeed, GAMAAN has relied on U.S. government-funded VPN and anti-censorship software providers like Psiphon to disseminate its surveys; collaborated with the USAID-funded, pro-regime change Tony Blair Institute; and collaborated with and received funding from historian Ladan Boroumand, co-founder of the Iranian regime-critical Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran, which is in turn supported by the U.S. government-funded National Endowment for Democracy (NED).

Likewise, for a February 2023 report on Iranians’ attitudes toward the anti-government protests, GAMAAN enlisted the help of U.S. government-linked Iran International and U.S. government-funded Voice of America Persian in circulating survey questions.

Founded in 2019, the logic behind GAMAAN’s founding was that, in the context of state repression, traditional survey approaches based on random sampling and in-person or telephone interviews fail to capture the population’s true beliefs regarding sensitive religious and political topics, because “individuals often censor their true views or even actively alter them to avoid scrutiny by authorities,” according to GAMAAN.

Instead, the group distributes its surveys via social media, VPN platforms such as Psiphon, and encrypted messaging platforms like Telegram, allowing respondents to participate anonymously.

Unlike traditional polling based on probability sampling—random selection of respondents and persistent follow-up to minimize non-responsiveness—GAMAAN uses a voluntary, opt-in model. Respondents are not randomly selected from the broader target population of literate Iranians over the age of 19.

Instead, GAMAAN says respondents are reached “through random sampling via the popular Internet censorship circumvention provider Psiphon VPN, as well as ensuing sharing by respondents on social networks (Telegram, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Twitter).”

Prior to its use of VPN platforms like Psiphon for sampling, GAMAAN had exclusively relied on surveys being shared on social media, a method also referred to as “multiple chain-referral sampling,” also known as “snowball sampling.”

To account for methodological issues with non-random sampling inherent to opt-in surveys, GAMAAN tries to circulate its polls across a range of channels “representing radically diverse social layers of society and political perspectives,” and adjusts response data using statistical methods meant to render the final polling data more representative of the target population (literate Iranians 19 years and older with internet access).

At times, the circulation of GAMAAN’s surveys has been aided by social media virality.

Using this unorthodox methodology, GAMAAN’s survey results have often surprised observers and contradicted the findings of long-established pollsters, such as Pew Research and Gallup, which employ conventional face-to-face and telephone polling methods. The group’s 2020 survey on Iranians’ religious beliefs made waves for its findings, which showed less religiosity among the Iranian population than was generally believed (and indicated in prior polling).

Among other surprising results, GAMAAN’s survey found 22% of respondents did not belong to any religion, 9% identified as atheist, and 47% reported “having transitioned from being religious to non-religious.” In contrast, Pew Research reported in 2009 that 99.4% of Iranians are Muslim.

But according to polling experts, GAMAAN’s findings cannot be generalized to the broader Iranian public due to significant bias in who its surveys reach. GAMAAN relies chiefly on the Psiphon VPN platform to circulate its survey questionnaires, with about 66% of respondents in its latest poll participating through the platform, and the remainder reached through Telegram (13.1%), Instagram (8.5%), WhatsApp (4.6%), X (1.5%), and the remaining 6.7% through other undisclosed channels.

According to polling experts, these methods suffer from “coverage bias” in that they fail to reach large segments of the Iranian population, including Iranians who do not use the internet or do not use VPNs or encrypted messaging.

Nor do GAMAAN’s methods account for the fact that Iranians who use Psiphon or come across its surveys through social media are different in important ways from the Iranian population as a whole, to which GAMAAN claims its findings can be generalized.

Indeed, GAMAAN’s survey links are frequently shared by vocal critics of the Iranian government, and demographic data reported by GAMAAN shows respondents are disproportionately urban (93.6% of respondents in its latest survey, vs. about 80% of the total Iranian population), college-educated (70.9% of respondents, compared to 27.7% of literate Iranians 19 years and older, per labor force statistics cited by GAMAAN); and high-income (54% of respondents had a “household monthly income above 13 million Rials,” compared to 40% among the target population, per GAMAAN’s methodology section).

“[F]or that inference that GAMAAN is making to be true, that this sample represents the Iranian population, the adult age population, we would have to assume or believe that Psiphon users are reflective of the Iranian population as a whole, which … just could not possibly be true,” Tavana said.

GAMAAN’s surveys have a high rate of repeat participation (i.e., a large share of respondents to a given survey participated in previous GAMAAN polling), with 26% of respondents in its most recent poll having participated in previous GAMAAN surveys, which GAMAAN interpreted as “indicating that the random sampling method was effective in distributing the questionnaire among a wide range of demographic groups, reaching far beyond networks familiar with GAMAAN.”

“The authors’ claim that this number provides evidence that their methods reach a random sample is a vast misinterpretation,” according to Kevan Harris, an associate professor of sociology at UCLA who was a principal investigator for the Iran Social Survey along with Tavana. “Indeed it is the opposite. This number, if true, is evidence of how this organization’s methods are reaching a relatively small, interconnected group of people who are predisposed to take their surveys.”

Harris highlighted that, per GAMAAN’s own methodology section in its most recent survey report, 5-11 million Iranians use Psiphon daily (the main source of survey participants), meaning the “refined sample” of 77,216 (which excludes “random or bot-entered responses,” per GAMAAN) constitutes approximately 0.7-1.5% of daily Psiphon users in Iran, yet GAMAAN reported that “26% of respondents had previously participated in GAMAAN’s surveys.”

“When you have a 26% repeat rate from what’s already less than 2% of your potential sample pool of Psiphon users (and less than 0.2% of all adult VPN users), that’s a major red flag about how representative your sample really is,” Harris wrote in an email to Noir.

[I]t shows they’re not really getting a random sample of all Iranians, just likely a small, enthusiastic subset who regularly take their surveys. Indeed, the 26% number, given this relatively large sample size, is telling.”

Sunghee Lee, an Associate Research Professor at the University of Michigan’s Survey Research Center, wrote in an email to Noir that “without further information,” she would agree with Harris’s assessment of the problematic nature of the high repeat-response rate.

“Based on my quick search, the adult population of Iran appears to be around 70 million. The sample of 77K from the 2024 June report accounts for 0.1% of the adult population. This means that, if a true probability sample is used for 77K, you are likely to be sampled 1 out of 1000 studies. The fact that 26% of the sample is a repeat group suggests that the sample is likely to represent a group much narrower in scope than the adult population.”

While GAMAAN purports to use “various balancing methods such as weighting and the sample matching method” to derive a representative sample from its raw survey data, survey experts interviewed by Noir said these methods can’t compensate for the unrepresentative nature of GAMAAN’s underlying data.

“[W]e use weights when we don’t know what the probability is that any given person will enter into a sample, and so we weight certain respondents in our sample more or less if we think that they were more or less likely to be chosen to be on our sample, we don’t have any way to assess that,” Tavana said.

“So what they call weights is actually just refining the sample so that on key demographics, the sample looks more like the Iranian [population]. But it’s not a probability sample to begin with[.]”

Stanford University social psychologist and survey methodologist Jon Krosnick concurred, writing in an email to Noir: “[T]he phrase ‘matching and weighting’ without disclosing the details also sounds like a snake oil salesman. There have been lots of claims that ‘matching and weighting’ have improved the accuracy of non-probability samples, but lots of published papers have shown that such methods failed rather than succeeding. I don’t know of a single one showing improvement in accuracy.”

Lee likewise expressed doubt that GAMAAN’s weighting and sample matching adjustments can yield a representative sample: “I am not entirely convinced that for a population with less than 30% with college education can be examined by a sample with more than 70% with college education even after the weighting is applied.”

Lee also noted that the Pew Research study GAMAAN links to in its June 2024 survey report when discussing the “raking” weighting method for adjusting online opt-in samples, which used over 30,000 online opt-in survey responses to evaluate weighting procedures and their ability to reduce bias, concluded that “[e]ven the most effective adjustment procedures were unable to remove most of the bias.”

Lee also highlighted that GAMAAN’s “sample is representative only on the dimensions that the study attempted to balance on. They are five demographic variables used in raking: age group, gender, level of education, residential area (urban or rural), and provincial population. Therefore, whether results on the study outcome variables (e.g., expected election turnout) are representative is debatable.”

“The bottom line for me is that abandoning random sampling in Iran or the U.S. leaves a researcher with no basis for generalizing the results of a survey to any population,” Krosnick wrote. “It’s fine to talk about the obtained results as describing the people who participated. But not to generalize.”

According to the survey experts interviewed by Noir, a chief issue with GAMAAN’s approach is the inappropriate generalization of its survey results to the entire Iranian adult population, rather than the (likely meaningfully different) participants in its surveys.

“This doesn’t mean [GAMAAN’s] surveys are useless, but their results should be presented much more cautiously, with clear acknowledgment that they represent opinions of a specific, self-selected subset of internet-using, politically engaged people – not the general population,” Harris wrote in an email to Noir. “This is especially crucial when the surveys cover sensitive political topics that might influence US/European policy or public opinion.”

“I have no doubt in my mind that with the data GAMAAN has, we could make inferences to Psiphon users, and frankly, that would be fascinating to know what Psiphon users think and believe about the Iranian government,” Tavana said.

It’s an incredibly important constituency we could generalize their findings to, and make inferences about, the activist population, maybe even the online population, right? That would be fine, but to say that it’s representative of the whole country … we would have to believe [all] of these things that we know are false. We would have to believe that Psiphon users in particular, but also Twitter and Telegram users are reflective of their population, and we already have substantial verified information that they are not.”

“GAMAAN tells us to believe that their findings are generalizable to the entire adult population, right? This is invalid,” Tavana said. “That conclusion does not follow from, even if we had their data, even if we knew what procedures they were following, how they were recruiting subjects and so on, that scientifically does not logically follow from what they are doing.”

Even the central premise of GAMAAN’s approach—that citizens of a country with a repressive, authoritarian state will not give honest answers to questions pertaining to sensitive political or cultural issues when an interviewer is present—is dubious, Krosnick wrote.

“[M]any studies have surprisingly shown that removing interviewers rarely causes responses to change much,” Krosnick wrote. “In general, if a person is going to participate in answering questions, why bother if the person is going to lie – it’s obviously easier just to decline to participate at all from the start or to break off mid-interview.”

GAMAAN has also drawn criticism for a lack of transparency in its methods and, with one exception, a failure to subject its work to the rigor and scrutiny of publishing in peer-reviewed academic journals.

“Because they don’t document carefully enough for scientific standards what they do, none of what they produce is replicable,” Tavana said. “This is compounded by the fact that their data is not publicly available. I cannot go and download their data and analyze it for myself, right?”

The only article based on GAMAAN’s survey work that has been published in a peer-reviewed academic journal to date, “Survey Zoroastrians: Online Religious Identification in the Islamic Republic of Iran,” primarily focuses on a single finding from GAMAAN’s 2020 survey on Iranians’ religious beliefs (which was “financially supported by and carried out in cooperation with Dr. Ladan Boroumand” of the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center, an Islamic Republic-critical organization supported by the U.S. government-funded National Endowment for Democracy) – that 8% of respondents identified as Zoroastrian (a far higher share than reported in previous research).

The paper does not use GAMAAN’s more controversial findings (such as those concerning Iranians’ political beliefs). Moreover, a note appended to the journal article states “[t]he raw data used for this research can be shared with researchers under a confidentiality and collaborative agreement with GAMAAN,” which Tavana characterized as “unusual.”

“Typically, we do not require these kinds of agreements for access to this type of data,” Tavana wrote in an email to Noir. “I have seen it before when the data is proprietary, or owned by a private company. But not data an academic has collected on their own. This means that no one – not the reviewers, the editorial staff, or anyone else – has verified the claims made in the article.”

“[B]ecause we cannot replicate what they do, because their data are not available, we don’t know whether the inferences [] they are making on that data are valid, and so we have to take them at their word, and there are many reasons why we probably should not take them at their word,” Tavana said.

GAMAAN’s methodological shortcomings may account for substantial differences seen between its findings and those of long-established pollsters using traditional probability sampling.

For instance, in a 2022 survey on Iranians’ political beliefs, GAMAAN reported far lower approval ratings for then-president Ebrahim Raisi compared to those reported by Gallup in a 2021 survey. GAMAAN itself highlighted this divergence (illustrated in the graphic below), but wrote that “both surveys are substantially similar … if Gallup’s results are compared with only the Principlists and Reformists in GAMAAN’s sample” (meaning, responses from more conservative and incrementalist participants in GAMAAN’s survey align with Gallup’s findings across its entire sample).

GAMAAN’s ties to US-funded regime-change orgs

Chief among GAMAAN’s ties to U.S. government-funded groups is the organization’s recent “partnership” with the Tony Blair Institute. GAMAAN “exclusively provided” the U.K. nonprofit with detailed survey data gathered in June 2020 (regarding Iranians’ religious beliefs), and February & December 2022 (regarding political systems and the Mahsa Amini street protests, respectively).

The Tony Blair Institute used GAMAAN’s survey data for a series of articles depicting the Iranian populace as eager for regime change, with one article titled “The People of Iran Are Shouting for Regime Change – But Is the West Listening?”.

Founded by former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, the Institute has received millions in grants from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), at least some of which were Cooperative Agreement grants “characterized by extended involvement between recipient and agency.”

The Tony Blair Institute is also funded by the U.K.’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (akin to the U.S. State Department), as well as private entities such as the French consulting firm Altai Consulting. Altai boasts the European Commission, USAID, and the French Development Agency as clients.

GAMAAN’s widely-discussed 2020 survey of Iranians’ religious beliefs was “financially supported by and carried out in cooperation with” Dr. Ladan Boroumand, co-founder and research director of the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center, a nonprofit focused on Iranian human rights abuses and critical of Iran’s Islamist government.

Named after her father Abdorrahman Boroumand, an Iranian lawyer and pro-democracy activist who was allegedly assassinated by Islamic Republic agents in 1991, the Center’s ‘Omid’ project documents cases of executions and assassinations in Iran in a searchable electronic database. The organization isn’t shy about supporting regime change, stating that its “goal is to prepare for a peaceful and democratic transition in Iran and build a more just future.”

The Boroumand Center has received substantial funding from the U.S. government-financed National Endowment for Democracy (NED), of which the Boroumand Center is a “partner.”

Ladan Boroumand has held multiple positions at the NED, including serving as a former Reagan-Fascell Democracy Fellow, researching “secularization in Iran,” a current member of the editorial board for the NED’s Journal of Democracy, as well as a current Research Council Member at the NED’s International Forum for Democratic Studies. She has also served on the Steering Committee of the World Movement for Democracy, of which the NED serves as the “secretariat.”

Ladan Boroumand is also on the advisory committee for the Atlantic Council’s Iran Strategy Project, which convened various experts and former officials “to develop a holistic US policy toward the Islamic Republic of Iran for the next four years.”

The Atlantic Council is an influential international relations think tank with extensive ties to U.S. lawmakers that receives large sums from the U.S. government (with FY 2023 grant obligations totaling over $6 million). The group’s October 2024 Iran Strategy Project report recommends a policy of continued pressure against the Islamic Republic, including through “enhanced support to the Iranian people” with the “long-term goal of supporting the Iranian people’s ability to change their system of government if they so desire.”

Ladan Boroumand was invited, along with her sister Roya Boroumand, to a July 2018 speech by former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the Reagan Library, amid the Trump administration’s pivot to a hardline posture towards the Islamic Republic. The two sisters likewise joined 12 other Iranian diaspora women in signing an August 2019 open letter calling for a “transition from the Islamic Republic.”

GAMAAN has also consulted with Dr. Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian lawyer and Nobel Peace Prize recipient, who has long worked with the U.S. government and the NED-funded Tavaana, a project of the E-Collaborative for Civic Education (ECCE), founded by staunch opponents of the Islamic Republic, Mariam Memarsadeghi and Akbar Atri.

Tavaana, which describes itself as “Iran’s premier civic education and civil society capacity building initiative,” aimed at ushering in democratic governance. It creates and disseminates anti-government media and information on anti-censorship tools, and has an extensive social media following. Memarsadeghi was also a signatory to the August 2019 open letter calling for a “transition from the Islamic Republic.”

Memarsadeghi is also the founder and director of the Cyrus Forum, an organization that supports ousting the Islamic Republic and works to “reverse engineer an Iranian government that upholds security, the rule of law, and individual liberty.” Ladan Boroumand is one of only two advisors to the Cyrus Forum and was previously listed on Tavaana’s website as a teacher.

Ebadi also appears to have been invited to the U.S. State Department’s 2017 Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) Implementers’ Conference, organized by the Department’s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, Office of Assistance Coordination (NEA/AC).

Ebadi’s name and role as president of the Centre for Supporters of Human Rights—a U.K. NGO focused on human rights issues in Iran that Ebadi founded—appear on a guest list circulated by the State Department in September 2017.

GAMAAN has also relied on U.S. government-funded virtual private network (VPN) providers Psiphon and Lantern for assistance in disseminating their surveys and bypassing Iranian government internet censorship.

Since at least 2021, GAMAAN has collaborated with Psiphon, an open-source tool for circumventing internet censorship (using VPN and other technologies) that was developed at the University of Toronto and publicly released in 2006. Psiphon has received millions in funding from the Open Technology Fund, which “receives the majority of its funding from the U.S. government via the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM).”

Psiphon, the Tony Blair Institute, the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center and Shirin Ebadi did not respond to requests for comment.

The Context

GAMAAN co-founder Ammar Maleki’s ire against the Islamic Republic is more than ideological; it’s personal. His father, Mohammad Maleki, who served as the first president of the University of Tehran, was a well-known critic of the country’s human rights abuses and use of the death penalty.

In 2019, the elder Maleki joined 13 other Iranian activists in signing a pair of open letters calling for Iran’s Supreme Leader to step down and a “complete and peaceful transition” away from the Islamic Republic. Ammar Maleki told Univers, the student newspaper of his employer, Tilburg University, “My father was imprisoned regularly until old age. Almost all the milestones in my life he missed.”

He makes his views on the Islamic Republic clear on X: “To understand/analyze the #Islamic_Republic of Iran, 3 golden rules should be kept in mind: 1- I.R. [Islamic Republic] cannot be reformed by dialogue but will surrender to pressure 2- I.R. officials lie unless proven otherwise 3- when I.R. officials/supporters say #Iran, they mean the I.R. only!”

Hardline politics are not unusual among academics. More unusual and concerning is Maleki’s willingness to accuse those who call into question GAMAAN’s findings and methodology of carrying water for the Islamic Republic. Daniel Tavana experienced this firsthand when he criticized GAMAAN’s methodology online.

“I understand that you have a hard time these days selling your data by IRGC-initiated IranPoll, so you attack GAMAAN to take attention. I cannot waste my time answering nonsense on GAMAAN’s method for an apologist! Our results were corroborated by external checks & field evidence,” Maleki wrote, referring to Tavana and the Iran Social Survey’s use of IranPoll to conduct surveys within Iran.

Noir couldn’t find evidence of IranPoll having ties to the Islamic Republic, and Maleki did not respond when we asked him to elaborate on the allegation. Tavana likewise stated, “IranPoll has no connection to the government [of Iran].”

Nonetheless, Maleki seems to allege that IranPoll’s work is evidence that Western universities “are under the control of the regime’s thugs,” as he wrote on X.

If mainstream media citations of GAMAAN’s findings are any indication, Maleki’s tenacity seems to be paying off.

Whether you’ve seen it in reports published by the State Department, the American Foreign Policy Council, the government of the United Kingdom, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, FiveThirtyEight, The Guardian, The Economist, CBC, Al-Monitor, The Jerusalem Post, Voice of America, the Wilson Center, DW News, Tablet Magazine, The Hill, The Washington Times, or Christianity Today, there’s a good chance that if you live in the West, GAMAAN has helped shape what you think is happening in Iran.

GAMAAN’s rise shows no signs of slowing: the organization announced in January that Maleki had been “selected as the country representative for Iran (2025-2026) in the prestigious World Association for Public Opinion Research (WAPOR).” The Washington Post described WAPOR as “the leading professional association of pollsters working outside the United States.”

For Tavana, GAMAAN isn’t merely worsening academic and mainstream conversation around Iran—it’s potentially providing justification for the kind of military confrontation that actually materialized last month.

“It wasn’t a very long time ago where, you know, the U.S. invaded another country, largely on the assumption that people who lived in that country wanted the invasion and [welcomed] their liberation … And so I think that, like, trafficking in these half-baked ideas is actually quite dangerous, and it’s going [to], if unchecked, get a lot of people killed,” Tavana said.

Trump's approval rating fell 10% since taking office in January, which includes a 17% decline among independents to 29%, matching his all-time lowest rating among the group. The president was, however, reported to have steady support among Republicans at 89%, while support among Democrats was consistently reported to be in the lower single digits, having dropped to 1% in June before increasing to 2% in July.

The poll was conducted between July 7 and July 21, days after Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' was signed into law on Independence Day (July 4). The president's handling of key foreign and domestic issues were also reported to have low approval ratings including his handling of the situation in Iran (42%), foreign affairs (41%), immigration (38%), the economy (37%), the Israel-Palestine conflict (36%), foreign trade (36%), the Russia-Ukraine war (33%) and the federal budget (29%).

Trump was also reported to be losing support among male voters, according to the latest CBS News/YouGov poll released last week. Trump was reported to have a -6 net approval rating among men, with a 47% approval rating and a 53% disapproval rating, the highest of any point during his second term in office.

The president began his current term at a +20 margin, with a 60% approval rating and 40% disapproval rating among male voters. Additionally, men supported Trump by a wider margin in his 2024 presidential election victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris than in his 2020 loss to former President Joe Biden, having narrowly won men under the age of 50, a group that had previously favored Biden by 10 points, according to PewResearch.org.

Trump's shift among male voters has been consistent since April, with his approval rating dropping from 58% to 49% and his disapproval rating rising from 42% to 51% on April 11. Polling expert Nate Silver claimed that the president's approval rating has reportedly ""started to drop more quickly"" in the latest edition of his Silver Bulletin Substack released last Tuesday (July 22).

Trump's net approval rating is currently at -8.9, which is a drop of -2.0 points in one week and only 0.8 points higher than the -9.7 net approval low point of his second term reported on April 29, but still about seven points higher than the same point of his first term, according to Silver. The president has reportedly seen a decrease in support for several policies including immigration (-3.4 to -7.4), economy (-12.1 to -14.1), trade (-14.5 to -17.5) and inflation (-24.5 to -24.8).

Additionally, the percentage of Americans who strongly approve of Trump's job performance has dropped below 27% for the first time during his second term with about 43% of respondents claiming they strongly disapprove of him."

https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/tiffany-network-shatters-paramount-cbs-144234404.html,,The  Tiffany Network  Shatters as Paramount - CBS Sells Its Soul Cheap,20250728T170000Z,https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_republic_521/b667fbf288c5eb3a81fbf0b0c77e49a3,yahoo.com,English,United States,"The sellout of the Columbia Broadcasting System’s journalistic values to commercial interests was foreshadowed in 1976, in Sidney Lumet and Paddy Chayefsky’s dark comedy satire Network; in James Brooks’s 1987 romantic comedy Broadcast News; and in Michael Mann and Eric Roth’s 1999 drama The Insider, explicitly calling out the revered CBS. However, it was insider Shari Redstone who completed the dreaded desecration last week.

Surely the capitulation to President Trump by Redstone, controlling owner of Paramount-CBS, to secure Federal Communications Commission clearance to sell her dwindling media empire to David Ellison of Skydance and Redbird Capital was a moment of tragic irony. We had saluted the board battles of Redstone, the seemingly underrated, high-integrity daughter of owner Sumner Redstone, in her difficult governance battles with the CEOs of Viacom and CBS, expecting that she would return the media powerhouses to their strategic positioning as engines of innovation. Sadly, they only atrophied further, consumed by internal reshuffling and missed opportunities for timely investments in programming and technologies.

As prominent media commentators such as Oliver Darcy and Matt Belloni point out, the payment of $16 million to the Trump Presidential Library from CBS News’s 60 Minutes over the objections of its executive producer (who resigned in protest) resembled payment of an extortion-like penalty to the government for the standard editing of an interview with Kamala Harris last summer.

Of course, Trump’s claims of “damage” ring especially hollow given not only that the transcript showed nothing irregular about the edits but also, of course, the fact he won the election. This happened just weeks after the final performance of George Clooney’s Broadway blockbuster Good Night and Good Luck, a tribute to the bold, legendary head of CBS News, Edward R. Murrow, and his team of noble journalists. This was followed by the cancellation of “King of Comedy” Stephen Colbert’s revered late show, seemingly over its satirical criticism of the Trump administration. The explanation that the show was too expensive and lost money raised many eyebrows, particularly given the lack of attempts to trim the 200-person production staff to bring it in line before its abrupt cancellation on the eve of Trump’s FCC merger approval.

But Paramount’s woes extend much deeper than a few rough weeks. Sadly, this media enterprise had stopped innovating for decades, despite the fast-moving programming and technologies of the strategic context of news and entertainment, on top of its own legendary history of innovation.

The venerable media brands of CBS, Paramount, and Viacom shared a history as pioneering entrepreneurs that actually wandered into each other’s paths repeatedly. They also shared histories of early innovation followed by decades of palace intrigue, succession battles, organizational churning, and strategic atrophy.

CBS was founded in 1927 as a radio network by a talent agent, Arthur Judson. A year later, William Paley acquired 51 percent of the network, while Paramount Pictures bought 49 percent. In the Depression, Paramount was forced to sell its stake to emerge from bankruptcy. Under Paley, CBS became known as “the Tiffany network,” given its high-quality programming, expanding into television in the 1940s; its news division, under Edward R. Murrow, became the gold standard of broadcast journalism. It spun out its syndication business, known as Viacom, in 1971. Paley had undermined a series of four highly regarded successors with sequential palace coups over 60 years, until the board finally removed him and sold the business to the Tisch family’s Loews firm, which later sold it to Westinghouse, which in turn sold it to Sumner Redstone.

Paramount was founded in 1912 by Hungarian immigrant Adolph Zukor, an investor in the older media sector of the nickelodeon, the first form of indoor exhibition space dedicated to showing projected motion pictures through individual machines. As large-screen technology developed, Zukor launched a chain of palatial theaters to distribute the films his studio produced. He also created the star system, which featured performers such as Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Gloria Swanson, Rudolph Valentino, W.C. Fields, Cary Grant, and the Marx Brothers. Paramount produced many great classic films, such as the Godfather movies, Psycho, Chinatown, and The Ten Commandments. Zukor pioneered many of the first animated cartoons, sound films (“talkies”), and musical films, and was an early investor in Bill Paley’s CBS broadcasting network; however, he surrendered that stake as part of Paramount’s bankruptcy reorganization during the Depression.

Meanwhile, NBC was created by David Sarnoff, a Russian immigrant and brilliant innovator, as a division of the Radio Corporation of America, or RCA, which he created in partnership with General Electric and Westinghouse in 1921. GE and Westinghouse were forced to divest their stakes due to antitrust concerns in 1932. At the 1939 New York World’s Fair, Sarnoff unveiled the first electronic black and white television and, later, in 1954, the first color television.

In 1948, the Supreme Court forced the divestiture of Paramount Studios from Paramount Theaters, separating production from exhibition. Leonard Goldenson, an antitrust attorney, bought the theater chain and merged it with ABC, which had been created in the court-ordered divestiture of one of NBC’s two networks. Paramount Studios became a major source of ABC TV shows. Paramount also opened a chain of amusement parks around the nation.

Gulf & Western, a large industrial conglomerate that manufactured automotive parts and purchased Paramount, was then led by Barry Diller and Michael Eisner, who produced many of the definitive box office hits of the late 1970 and 1980s, such as Airplane!, Ordinary People, Terms of Endearment, and the Indiana Jones franchise. Diller left to create Fox Television, while Eisner left to save Disney.

In the 1990s, Sumner Redstone’s Viacom, which had been CBS television’s syndication business, took control of Paramount and then merged back with CBS in 2000 but later spun out CBS in 2005, only to push to reunite them a decade later. In May 2016, the fast-fading 93-year-old Sumner Redstone removed Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman and George Abrams, a longtime Viacom board member, as members of his trust, which controls Redstone’s ownership of National Amusements, which, in turn, controls 80 percent of Viacom and CBS.

Dauman and Abrams expressed shock and outrage at the decision, but many wondered what took so long, given Dauman’s faltering performance. At that time, Dauman was one of the highest-paid CEOs in the nation (earning $85 million a year between 2011 and 2015), but Viacom’s stock price was down by 50 percent over the year, with the once-mighty cable channels of MTV and VH1 having gone creatively stale and the legendary Paramount studios all but moribund as Redstone, like Paley, churned through four highly regarded expected successors, staying in power into his nineties.





Since Sumner Redstone began the process of handing over control to Shari in 2016, Paramount stock has nosedived 75 percent, wiping out tens of billions of dollars in value and shrinking to a valuation of merely $8 billion, a fraction of the roughly $80 billion it was worth when Sumner was at his peak in 2001.

Graph

That value decline has been a long time coming, as media peers soared past the once-thriving Viacom and CBS empires, which had rotted from within, lethargic and seemingly watching as the world passed them by. Remarkably, in stark contrast to its peers, the company did not make a single major acquisition or enter a new business line over the last two decades.

Over the same period, Disney-ABC and Comcast-NBC brilliantly reinvented themselves with far better entertainment products, expanded highly profitable theme park investments with amusements showcasing films and TV shows, enhanced sports programming, and fortified respected news coverage. Disney, under its revered CEO Bob Iger, has undergone several transformations. Its film franchises (The Avengers, the Frozen movies, and Black Panther) consistently enjoyed widespread critical acclaim and set box office records. Wisely, Iger purchased Pixar for $7.4 billion, from which Disney has reaped over $40 billion. The subsequent $4 billion acquisition of Marvel has netted Disney $13 billion, followed by the $4 billion purchase of Lucasfilm, which has generated $12 billion.

Similarly, Comcast has captured a significant share of the media market following its complete acquisition of NBCUniversal for $39 billion in 2013, with continued innovation. Comcast-NBCUniversal has churned out hit after hit in its content—The Office, 30 Rock, the One Chicago and Law & Order franchises. Moreover, Universal Pictures, the studio unit, had huge blockbusters such as Oppenheimer and Wicked. Its Peacock streaming business has delivered $4.9 billion in revenue last year with 46 percent annual growth.

All Paramount seems to have accomplished in those years was the fruitless meiosis and mitosis of Viacom, CBS, and Paramount being constantly stapled together and torn apart, only to be pasted together again. Such waves of unification and dissolution were distractions from creative risk taking and business building, as they hindered the adoption of new technologies and the discovery of adjacent entertainment properties. The repeat business marriages and divorces mirrored the head-spinning matrimonial volatility of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.

The revival of NBC and ABC is proof that old brands can be either wasted or revitalized. Humorist Fred Allen, an old CBS radio star from back in the golden age, once complained that “imitation is the highest form … of television.” Had CBS only copied its peers, it would have been in far better shape.

In fairness, Skydance is buying not just venerable old brand names but undervalued current properties. Amazingly, CBS is hitting a record seventeenth consecutive season as the most watched network, with the top seven prime-time shows, not to mention streaming hits such as Paramount’s Yellowstone. Thus Skydance is getting a bargain that Redstone is handing off wrongly at distress prices.

With deal closure expected next week, the new Paramount-CBS will be 70 percent owned by Skydance Media and 30 percent by public owners. And what is Skydance? It was founded in 2006 by CEO David Ellison, a former actor, who is expected to become chairman-CEO of the new combined entity. He’s the son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, a Trump supporter and the second-wealthiest person in the world with $280 billion.

David Ellison was backing Joe Biden—he gave Biden nearly a million dollars in April 2024 before Biden dropped out. Nonetheless, media experts were concerned by the exits of such respected leaders as CBS News chief Wendy McMahon and 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens, who resigned due to their opposition to the deal. The apparent courtship of the divisive journalist and Free Press founder Bari Weiss has also raised eyebrows about a prospective fusing of Free Press with CBS News. On the other hand, the new appointment of respected insider Tanya Simon to replace Owens at the helm of 60 Minutes was received as an encouraging move.

Yet still, key news leadership changes on top of the shameful shakedown of 60 Minutes and the politically driven cancellation of the hugely popular Colbert show, are beyond troubling. Ominously, according to reports, Paramount also surrendered to the hiring of an ombudsman at CBS News to be charged with investigating complaints of political bias, with the concession made in a letter to the FCC that “in all respects, Skydance will ensure that CBS’s reporting is fair, unbiased, and fact-based.”

Such tragic capitulation of First Amendment rights, accompanied by a demoralizing and brand-tarnishing political appeasement, followed decades of self-destructive value erosion. The turbulence of these last few weeks for Paramount seems a fitting capstone for Shari Redstone’s turbulent run at the helm of this storied but struggling company. Our private independent media enterprises are public treasures. They must not become state propaganda outlets. As CBS News titan Edward R. Murrow warned, 65 years ago: “To be persuasive, we must be believable. To be believable, we must be credible. To be credible, we must be truthful.… A nation of sheep will beget a government of wolves.”"
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/maddow-blog-trump-adds-kamala-153215861.html,,"Maddow Blog | Trump adds Kamala Harris , Beyoncé and Oprah to the list of those he wants prosecuted",20250728T170000Z,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mkCCA5Im8UjLg25KckphvQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/msnbc_articles_593/f5e9400736fa6b6067fc6c425f46e16d,yahoo.com,English,United States,"A couple of weeks after joining his party’s national ticket, then-Sen. JD Vance was eager to ease the minds of voters concerned about Donald Trump and his threats of retaliation. Trump, the future vice president said at the time, is “not a vengeful guy.”

Shortly after the election, Trump appeared on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” and suggested vengeance wasn’t part of his plans for a second term. “I’m not looking to go back into the past,” he said, adding, “Retribution will be through success.” The Republican president echoed the point in his second inaugural address, declaring, “Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents.”

I have some bad news for anybody who believed any of these claims. The Hill reported:

President Trump on Saturday doubled down on his accusations that former Vice President Harris paid celebrities to endorse her during the 2024 presidential election. The president, echoing previous claims that Harris paid Beyoncé, Oprah and Al Sharpton to support her White House bid throughout the campaign trail, said Harris and the celebrities involved should be ‘prosecuted.’

(Disclosure note: Sharpton hosts a program on MSNBC, my employer.)

I’ve lost count how many times the president has made this claim, which continues to be demonstrably wrong. As for why the Republican interrupted his trip to Scotland to push this falsehood again — which included some all-caps hysterics and a variety of exclamation points — your guess is as good as mine.

I don’t seriously expect anything to come of this, because federal prosecutors know what Trump does not: Bringing criminal charges against political foes based on made-up allegations doesn’t work.

But before that observation brings comfort to anyone, it’s important to acknowledge the broader landscape. The New York Times, assessing Trump’s intensifying campaign of retribution, reported last week, “This is what Washington thought retribution would look like.""

When President Trump started his second term, there were deep fears among current and former Justice Department officials, legal experts and Democrats that Mr. Trump would follow through on his repeated promises to ‘lock up’ or otherwise pursue charges against high-profile figures like Liz Cheney, James B. Comey and former President Barack Obama. Mr. Trump quickly went after perceived enemies — but not always the anticipated ones and often not in the anticipated ways.

The Times’ analysis noted that the Republican has displayed “a willingness to weaponize the federal government” in novel and audacious ways, and there’s ample evidence to bolster the point. Just last week, for example, Trump falsely and repeatedly accused Barack Obama of “treason,” suggesting the former Democratic president should be prosecuted over made-up allegations. Soon after, Trump talked up the idea of prosecuting Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California, too.

That came on the heels of news that the Trump administration had launched criminal investigations into former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey, two longtime targets of the president. (Disclosure note: Brennan is a paid contributor to MSNBC and NBC News.)

They’re part of a growing list. In April, for example, Trump signed two first-of-their-kind executive orders that targeted a pair of officials from his first term who defied him. There was barely a pretense in the orders that the targeted former officials — Christopher Krebs, who led the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Miles Taylor, a former high-ranking Department of Homeland Security official — had done anything wrong. Indeed, the closer one looked at the stated rationales in support of the directives, the more ridiculous they appeared.

Nevertheless, the president directed Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Department of Homeland Security to launch a “review” into Krebs, while simultaneously ordering DHS to investigate Taylor.

Weeks later, Trump broke new ground again, directing the Justice Department to launch a wide-ranging investigation into Joe Biden and officials in the Democrat’s administration, based on Republican conspiracy theories about the former president’s mental health. It was an unprecedented move: An incumbent American president had never before publicly ordered a federal probe of his predecessor.

There was a degree of irony to the circumstances. After his defeat in the 2020 election, Trump spent years insisting that Biden had ordered an investigation into him — an odd conspiracy theory for which there is literally no evidence — but Trump then did exactly what he falsely accused his predecessor of doing.

Trump also endorsed California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s arrest, before demanding that CNN face criminal prosecution for running reports the White House didn’t like.

And did I mention that, over the last several weeks, a Democratic mayor, a Democratic U.S. House member, the staffer of a different Democratic U.S. House member, a sitting judge and a labor leader have all been criminally charged, detained or taken into custody by Trump administration officials? Because that happened, too.

There are also ongoing Trump administration investigations into Media Matters, ActBlue, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New York Attorney General Letitia James and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy.

The president also wants to see Harris, Beyonce and Oprah added to his prosecution list.

Last week, the official White House social media account published a weird item with just six words of text: “They came after the wrong man.” The sentence appeared alongside a large image featuring the words, “I was the hunted — NOW I’M THE HUNTER,” attributed to Trump.

In other words, a sitting American president, using White House resources to promote North Korea-level propaganda, pushed a twisted message about his determination to seek vengeance against other Americans.

I’m disinclined to look away because I’m mindful of the degree to which Trump has surrounded himself with loyalists who will turn his rhetoric into action. As the aforementioned New York Times analysis added:

Repeatedly in his first term, Mr. Trump accused his perceived enemies of treason and tried to push the F.B.I. and Justice Department to indict them. He told his chief of staff that he wanted to ‘get the I.R.S.’ on those who crossed him. Many of them were investigated, and two of them were the subjects of highly unusual and invasive audits, but none of them were ever charged. The difference now is that Mr. Trump, much more so than during his first term, is surrounded by aides and cabinet members who often appear willing to follow through on his angriest and most authoritarian impulses.

The Times’ report added, “[T]he efforts to target top officials from previous administrations appears to be gaining momentum.” Watch this space.

The ""political theater"" party is projecting that onto Trump's foreign policy:

Trump's foreign policy is grounded in vengeance and political theater.

Let's go back to Lyin' Chuck Schumer's assessment of Trump's first 100 days:

Trump's first 100 days in office have been a failure.



Failure on the economy

Failure to lower costs

Failure on foreign policy

Failure on democracy

Failure everywhere you look — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) April 30, 2025

That's what the Democrats say.

Now let's check back in with the reality of the situation when it comes to foreign policy:

🚨WHOA: CNN is SHOCKED to report how DOMINANT President Trump is on foreign policy when compared to Democrats.

Here's the full text from @Townhallcom in case you can't see it all above:

""Despite EVERYTHING that's going on in the world right now, Republicans are more trusted on Democrats when it comes to foreign policy!"" ""In the American voters' minds, Democrats, simply put, can't hack it!"" Approval ratings of President Trump's strikes on Iran saw a 10 point swing. President Trump's America First foreign policy agenda is POPULAR. The Democrats can't compete.

Alternate headline: Democrat and media gaslighting efforts have failed.

This one surprised me a bit, but Americans say Democrats cannot hack it on foreign policy.



The GOP holds a 6 pt lead in July on who is more trusted. The same as Trump's lead over Harris in 2024.

The more the public learned about the Iran strikes, the more they approved. The Democrats have the opposite problem and it shows up in the party's 35-year low favorability rating.

Over the weekend, Trump claimed that Beyoncé broke the law after allegedly getting paid $11 million to appear at a Houston rally for Harris in October 2024.

This isn't the first time Bey has been accused of receiving eight figures to endorse the Democratic candidate. Last year, Trump supporters circulated rumors that Harris' campaign had paid Beyoncé $10 million for her rally appearance.

However, there is no basis or evidence to support any of these claims. Federal campaign records show Harris' campaign paid Beyoncé’s production company $165,000, a payment that was listed as a ""campaign event production"" expense. A Harris campaign spokesperson said last year that they didn't pay for celebrity endorsements, but they were required by law to cover costs connected to their event appearances.

The White House has yet to provide evidence of Trump's $11 million payment claim. When the president referred to the alleged eight-figure payment last year, Trump simply said: “Somebody just showed me something. They gave her $11 million.”

Amid Trump's latest comments, a Harris spokesperson cited remarks from Beyoncé’s mother, Tina Knowles, who said in November that the $10 million payment was a “lie."" Knowles also noted that the claim was taken down by Instagram as “False Information.” A spokesperson for Beyoncé also previously stated that the allegation was “beyond ridiculous.”

Trump on Sunday (July 27) also criticized other payments from the Harris campaign to organizations connected to prominent endorsers.

“Kamala, and all of those that received Endorsement money, BROKE THE LAW. They should all be prosecuted! Thank you for your attention to this matter,"" he wrote."

Trump's approval rating fell 10% since taking office in January, which includes a 17% decline among independents to 29%, matching his all-time lowest rating among the group. The president was, however, reported to have steady support among Republicans at 89%, while support among Democrats was consistently reported to be in the lower single digits, having dropped to 1% in June before increasing to 2% in July.

The poll was conducted between July 7 and July 21, days after Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' was signed into law on Independence Day (July 4). The president's handling of key foreign and domestic issues were also reported to have low approval ratings including his handling of the situation in Iran (42%), foreign affairs (41%), immigration (38%), the economy (37%), the Israel-Palestine conflict (36%), foreign trade (36%), the Russia-Ukraine war (33%) and the federal budget (29%).

Trump was also reported to be losing support among male voters, according to the latest CBS News/YouGov poll released last week. Trump was reported to have a -6 net approval rating among men, with a 47% approval rating and a 53% disapproval rating, the highest of any point during his second term in office.

The president began his current term at a +20 margin, with a 60% approval rating and 40% disapproval rating among male voters. Additionally, men supported Trump by a wider margin in his 2024 presidential election victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris than in his 2020 loss to former President Joe Biden, having narrowly won men under the age of 50, a group that had previously favored Biden by 10 points, according to PewResearch.org.

Trump's shift among male voters has been consistent since April, with his approval rating dropping from 58% to 49% and his disapproval rating rising from 42% to 51% on April 11. Polling expert Nate Silver claimed that the president's approval rating has reportedly ""started to drop more quickly"" in the latest edition of his Silver Bulletin Substack released last Tuesday (July 22).

Trump's net approval rating is currently at -8.9, which is a drop of -2.0 points in one week and only 0.8 points higher than the -9.7 net approval low point of his second term reported on April 29, but still about seven points higher than the same point of his first term, according to Silver. The president has reportedly seen a decrease in support for several policies including immigration (-3.4 to -7.4), economy (-12.1 to -14.1), trade (-14.5 to -17.5) and inflation (-24.5 to -24.8).

Additionally, the percentage of Americans who strongly approve of Trump's job performance has dropped below 27% for the first time during his second term with about 43% of respondents claiming they strongly disapprove of him."

By Max Greenwood

Campaigns & Elections sat down last month with two campaign veterans to discuss the political landscape and the future of national campaigns at a whirlwind moment in U.S. politics.

The conversation touched on the increasing nationalization of state and local campaigns, the changing technology and media environment and the need for senior staffers and operatives to understand, not just politics, but culture in the modern era of campaigns.

It also delved into the shifting political allegiances of key voting blocs and the forces driving those changes.

The panel featured Gail Gitcho, a communications director and adviser at Gail Gitcho Group and a longtime hand on Republican campaigns, as well as Maya Rupert, the former campaign manager for Democrat Julian Castro’s 2020 presidential campaign who later became a senior adviser on Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s White House bid.

The following excerpts from the discussion have been edited for length and clarity.

C&E: Gail, you were an advisor to [Republican] Herschel Walker’s 2022 Senate campaign in Georgia. That was obviously a statewide race, but it had huge national implications. How do you approach a campaign like that? Do campaign staffers and managers and consultants need to be more prepared for things to go national?

Gail Gitcho: That’s such a great question. Honestly, it sounds so simple to say, but you have to work hard. You have to put the hours in. Whether you’re a local operative or an intern or anyone, it’s just like anything else. You have to want it. You have to work really hard. I mean, I’ve seen staffers that are like, “okay, it’s six o’clock, I’m going to head out.” And I’m like, well, you’re never going to make it. You know that you have to pay your dues, put in your time and be in the foxhole at all times.

And when the national media descends on your state – because it is very salacious, it’s very headline driven – the campaign has to own it. You have to be on offense every single moment. So that is really the goal. Whether you have a statewide race like that, or you have a national race like the presidential campaigns, you have to be on offense all the time. If you’re not on your heels in those scenarios, then you don’t deserve to win, because you’re missing these opportunities to be on offense.

That’s how you get the positive stories. That’s what gets your side out. That’s what reaches the voters. That’s what hopefully makes the headlines. That’s what makes it around on social media. I think that’s why President Trump is where he is. He’s always on offense. There’s never a time where he is on defense. You see him going up against reporters that are hard nosed, that have studied him. I think JD Vance is the same way.

That’s what campaigners have to keep in mind, is the campaign has to be on offense. You have to know what your message is, and you have to drive it. And that requires working very, very hard no matter what race you’re on.

C&E: Maya, I want to throw the same question to you. You managed [Democrat] Maya Wiley’s mayoral campaign in New York. It’s the largest city in the country, and so there’s still a kind of national interest in it. At the same time, when you’re running this campaign, you have to keep it focused on issues like local transportation and affordability. How do you balance those competing pressures?

Maya Rupert: I think at the end of the day, mayoral races and gubernatorial races can reach the national stage. And they are right now for a lot of reasons. But at the end of the day, if you’re running for those offices and you’re working on those campaigns, you need to be hyper focused on what the voters are focused on.

New York City voters deserve a mayor that is talking about them, right? And I think that one of the things that we have seen with the success of someone like [Zohran] Mamdani, for example, is he is talking relentlessly about the issues that matter to New York. There will always be invitations to nationalize a race like that one, because it’s New York City, right? I mean, the New York City Mayor becomes a national figure because of the size of New York City. But I think it’s also because of the moment we’re in right now.

There are a lot of people who are looking at what is going on right now and want to be that front line of defense between the people and emerging authoritarianism. Who are going to be the people really pushing back? And people start to look to their local leaders, they look to their state leaders to constrain executive power. So that really does nationalize a lot of those conversations.

You need to be able to do two things. You need to be able to situate the race within the national sphere, because it would be silly not to. To Gail’s point, yes, you do constantly need to be taking advantage of every opportunity. And if that’s the conversation, you want that campaign to be a part of this larger mosaic of what people are doing across the country. This is what we’re seeing in states all over. This is what is energizing Democrats. But it can’t be national politics all the time, right? I think Mamdani did such a great job in constantly bringing the issues back to the people who are living in New York City, and I think that’s important. That’s what voters want and it is what they deserve, and we need campaigns that are worthy of their votes.

I think we’re going to see this again in 2026. It’s going to be the same thing, right? Everything is going to get nationalized, because there’s a national appetite for change and resistance. But for people who are running at a local level, they need to keep laser focused on what they’re running for and let their campaign be a part of that national conversation, but let their issues and their focus remain on their people.

C&E: Switching gears and looking at the future, what kind of changes have you seen in the world of national campaigning? Outline some of the big ones that stand out to you and what you think has been really transformational to the campaign business.

Gitcho: First of all, it’s the electorate. I mean, Republicans used to do much better in midterm years, and now Republicans are doing better in presidential years, and that is because Republican voters have a new coalition. And it’s important to talk about this new coalition, because we’re going to have to keep it together. Last cycle, in ’24, we saw people making less than $50,000 a year and the less educated go overwhelmingly for Trump. That used to not be the case. I mean, those are Democrat voters, but now they go for Trump. The thing is, they’re also lower propensity, so they are not going to be voting in the midterms as much as a coalition. The challenge is for 2026 for Republicans. This new coalition – people who earn under $50,000 and don’t have a college degree – how do you get them to the polls? How do you get them to turn out?

We have all of this incredible technology now. I mean, you’ve got this social media thing, and you have texting and all of these things that are really hyper-targeting voters. You can do your best to turn them out, but traditionally, they have not been part of the Republican coalition. So the challenge for Republicans is: can we keep it together for 2026? Same for 2028. I mean, you’re not going to have Donald Trump running again, so what does the next generation of Republicans do?

Donald Trump has laid out a playbook for how to create this coalition and how to keep it together. It will be up to whoever the next nominee is, whoever the next generation of Republicans are, to figure out, “okay, what from this playbook can I use to keep this coalition together that turns out in election years?” And a lot of it has to do with just listening to them.

I go back to the change I saw when Hillary Clinton talked about the “basket of deplorables.” And right then was just a moment for me, and I thought, “Oh my gosh, she’s saying the quiet part out loud.” She was saying that poor people are icky or that less-educated people have no business supporting her or being in her coalition. And it felt to me like a shift. It was absolutely an elitist move. And so Republicans were able to capitalize on that by just saying, “wait a second, you know we’re for more jobs, better jobs, lower taxes, keeping your housing affordable – all that stuff.” That was part of the reason why this coalition came together. You saw the same thing with Kamala Harris, that voters making less than $50,000 without a college degree went for Trump. So it’s just that’s how the electorate has changed.

C&E: Maya, do you have any thoughts on the changes that you’ve seen since your first national campaign? Are there any big changes that you are looking toward as you work with causes and candidates? Is there anything that you think has been transformational or will be transformational in the way you do your job?

Rupert: I think the coalition that’s going to win for Democrats is a multiracial coalition of working voters and working-poor voters, coming together and realizing that we, as communities, have more in common than what our opponents try to divide us on. And I think that when we see the political imagination of Democratic voters captured, of young progressive voters captured – I think that that is the key to moving forward.

That means being able to speak to voters across differences, not to ignore differences, but to speak to people across communities. I think right now the Democratic Party is grappling with just that; with how to get that done. There are some voices that are urging us to sort of turn away from our roots as a party, to stop listening to the groups in our coalition, and to sort of focus on certain issues and pretend as though they impact every community the same way. And I do not think that that is going to work for us.

People know how things actually are playing out for them and their neighbors, and we need to be able to tap into that…I definitely think that there is an assumption that there is some kind of a cultural divide between a number of Democrats and a number of working voters. I think that perception is not the reality, and it’s certainly not the reality in people’s policies. What we need to do is figure out a way to link what people are saying they want to do for families to the perception of Democrats as people who are fighters for working and poor people across this country.

For a very long time, there has been a lot of this message of “don’t worry, we’ll return to things being okay.” But it makes the assumption that everything was okay. I think people saw Democrats as saying, “don’t worry, we’ll pull us back.” And I think what voters are telling us, across the board, is that the system as it is is not working for people. They want bold solutions. And I don’t think that they’re necessarily saying we want bold solutions that look like x. They’re saying we want bold solutions, and we’re only hearing those solutions come from one person.

I think what Democrats need to do is stand strong in values and show people that, no, we’re not just nibbling around the edges. We’re talking about coming in and changing things and changing things for the better.

C&E: It seems to me that both of you are making a similar argument. We’ve seen success by candidates that offer big change and translate the frustration and disappointment that voters feel into a workable, communicable message – candidates who can tap into something deeper.

If you’re a campaign manager, a senior advisor, a deputy campaign manager, to what extent will you need to understand, not just the nuts and bolts of politics, but also culture and being able to translate a candidate’s message and their vision into real things that people can grab onto? Do you need to understand that culture now in a way that maybe you didn’t have to in the past?

Gitcho: Yes. For us, it’s being able to capitalize on the Democratic Party identity crisis – and my own view is that the Dems are having an identity crisis. They don’t know who they are anymore. You’ve got part of the party who is going far, far left, and then you’ve got the other part that’s like, hold on a second, that’s not who we are.

But when they’re pushing issues like partial-birth abortion or late-term abortion, people just can’t get on board with that. Having trans surgeries for minors without the consent of parents – people can’t get on board with that. Having a wide-open border without knowing who is coming in – people can’t get on board with that.

For Republicans, what you saw was the capitalization on that in the debates and in advertising and on TV. I remember seeing an MSNBC segment, it was like Rachel Maddow and I think Jen Psaki. They were on TV and they were commenting on a poll that was just released saying that immigration was the number one issue for voters, and they were laughing at it. That’s the moment that I was like, wait, why are you laughing at it? That’s what that’s what people think. So if you’re not going to listen, fine with me. But I couldn’t believe the reaction that it was funny. Like, anybody that lives in New York, that hangs out in a green room – they don’t know what is happening in border towns or border states, or what it’s like for people to feel unsafe because of what they’re seeing on the news. You know that that’s not funny, that’s reality.

Rupert: So I would say yes, it’s definitely important that senior campaign officials understand both the politics and the cultural piece. And I think it’s particularly important because, at this point, we are dealing with culture being dictated by information that is not true. There is no such thing as a partial-birth portion. That’s not a thing. No one is pushing for minor trans kids to have surgery without the consent of their parents. These are fear mongering tactics that are being used to paint positions as radical and beyond a point of reasonableness.

What we need as Democrats is to be able to, with moral clarity, stand in our values and say, “I absolutely support abortion rights for every single person, and no, no one is saying ‘have a partial birth abortion’.”

We can’t treat these things like they don’t matter. But the fact of the matter is that people hear that more than they hear the actual position. And so figuring out a way to get the culture piece to match up to what the politics and the policy actually are is going to be really important. It’s going to be especially important in a media environment that is consistently less concerned with getting the facts right."

Over the weekend, Trump claimed that Beyoncé broke the law after allegedly getting paid $11 million to appear at a Houston rally for Harris in October 2024.

This isn't the first time Bey has been accused of receiving eight figures to endorse the Democratic candidate. Last year, Trump supporters circulated rumors that Harris' campaign had paid Beyoncé $10 million for her rally appearance.

However, there is no basis or evidence to support any of these claims. Federal campaign records show Harris' campaign paid Beyoncé’s production company $165,000, a payment that was listed as a ""campaign event production"" expense. A Harris campaign spokesperson said last year that they didn't pay for celebrity endorsements, but they were required by law to cover costs connected to their event appearances.

The White House has yet to provide evidence of Trump's $11 million payment claim. When the president referred to the alleged eight-figure payment last year, Trump simply said: “Somebody just showed me something. They gave her $11 million.”

Amid Trump's latest comments, a Harris spokesperson cited remarks from Beyoncé’s mother, Tina Knowles, who said in November that the $10 million payment was a “lie."" Knowles also noted that the claim was taken down by Instagram as “False Information.” A spokesperson for Beyoncé also previously stated that the allegation was “beyond ridiculous.”

Trump on Sunday (July 27) also criticized other payments from the Harris campaign to organizations connected to prominent endorsers.

“Kamala, and all of those that received Endorsement money, BROKE THE LAW. They should all be prosecuted! Thank you for your attention to this matter,"" he wrote."

House and Senate lawmakers will need to strike a deal on funding the federal government by then – and while that deadline is still weeks away, Congress’ August recess means that they have just 14 legislative days with both chambers in session to come to an agreement.

That will be no easy feat, considering both House and Senate Republicans are working with three-seat majorities.

Meanwhile, there’s already divisions being sown over the viability of a short-term extension of fiscal year 2025 (FY2025) government funding levels, known as a continuing resolution (CR).

148 Democrats Back Noncitizen Voting In Dc As Gop Raises Alarm About Foreign Agents

Some fiscal conservatives in the House have suggested they could get behind a full-year CR, an idea that mainstream Republicans and defense hawks have balked at.

Read On The Fox News App

""I think we ought to start planning for a full-year CR,"" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris, R-Md., told reporters last week. ""A funding freeze in a setting of 2.7% inflation actually is a real cut in the size of the scope of government.""

Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., a member of the conservative group, told Fox News Digital, ""I would be open to that."" He added, however, ""But really, a CR is kind of a surrender.""

Others, like Rep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz., said, ""I never like CRs, but we’ll see how it plays out.""

But one House GOP lawmaker who spoke with Fox News Digital under the condition of anonymity argued it could have dangerous effects on military funding.

""It’s absolutely ridiculous,"" the lawmaker said. ""That destroys our defense. I mean, if it’s a CR encompassing everything, that’s…contrary to everything they’ve ever said before. But when has that stopped the Freedom Caucus?""

The idea of extending the previous year’s government funding levels has traditionally been anathema to Republicans, particularly in the House, where lawmakers have tried for several years to pass 12 individual, single-subject spending bills.

House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris said he would support a full-year CR.

It’s not something that’s been accomplished in years, however. And with Republicans having spent months working on President Donald Trump’s ""big, beautiful"" policy bill, GOP lawmakers have acknowledged they’ve been left with precious little time.

Many of those lawmakers suggested some sort of short-term CR could be likely to give appropriators more time to reach a deal while avoiding a temporary shutdown.

""I mean, we seem to be having trouble getting the appropriations bills moved through, and so we’re going to have to do something,"" Rep. Lloyd Smucker, R-Pa., told Fox News Digital. ""And I think if we’re doing a CR that keeps funding levels close to where they are now, a lot of members of the conference would support that.""

Thom Tillis Announces Retirement From Senate After Clash With Trump

One source close to the House Appropriations Committee told Fox News Digital they believe a short-term CR is a likely scenario, but did not mention the prospects of a year.

""I don't know that we’re there yet, but if that’s the option available, we certainly can’t afford any type of government shutdown – especially under full control by Republicans,"" another member, Rep. Scott Fitzgerald, R-Wis., told Fox News Digital.

Meanwhile, a small group of conservatives is warning they’re dedicated to opposing any form of CR.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson must shepherd their two chambers toward an agreement.

""I’m not voting for a September 30th CR. That is totally unacceptable,"" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., wrote on X last week. ""I’m giving everyone adequate notice.""

Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., pointed out FY2025 levels were set under the Biden administration.

""Why would we want to do the Biden policies and budget?"" Biggs asked.

And many Senate Republicans scoffed at the idea of doing another government funding extension, let alone a year-long CR. Most want to actually give the appropriations process a shot rather than continue the status quo of last-minute government funding.

""I have no interest in a year-long CR,"" Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., told Fox News Digital. ""I think Congress needs to actually take the responsibility for looking at spending. I don't think having a CR, which is basically a continuation of a Biden era, is appropriate.""

Rounds and other appropriators want to see the process through, something that hasn’t been accomplished since the late 1990s. But time is running thin for lawmakers, given that the House is already on recess and the upper chamber may stick around for a portion of August.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, argued that the appropriations process, which has been largely sidelined for years because of CRs, could still work, but warned that it could be undermined by another government funding extension or more rescissions packages from the White House.

""We're going to have an opportunity to be on the floor with an appropriations bill before we go on break for August,"" she said. ""So I refuse to say appropriations is ‘pretty broken.’""

So far, the Senate Appropriations Committee has finished work on six funding bills, and moved through a key hurdle for the House’s funding bill for military construction and the VA last week. The House of Representatives has passed two of 12 individual appropriations bills, though the two already make up roughly half the discretionary funding Congress must lay out.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said the appropriations process was not ""broken.""

Other Republicans similarly do not want to see another funding extension, and would rather focus on passing Trump’s roughly $1.7 trillion budget that he submitted to lawmakers earlier this year.

""Hopefully we don't have to go get to a CR, but if we get to a CR, what I don't want is, I don't want some blowout spending bill, which is what we have done since I've been here,"" Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fl., told Fox News Digital.

Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., also preferred to tackle Trump’s budget, but believed that lawmakers were already ""late to the ball.""

""I would like to go through a regular order where we consider all 12 of these buckets within the appropriations bill, all 2,400 line items, piece by piece on the floor, and make everybody defend their bridges to nowhere,"" Marshall said. ""I think that'll cut out a lot of the nonsense.""

Trump's approval rating fell 10% since taking office in January, which includes a 17% decline among independents to 29%, matching his all-time lowest rating among the group. The president was, however, reported to have steady support among Republicans at 89%, while support among Democrats was consistently reported to be in the lower single digits, having dropped to 1% in June before increasing to 2% in July.

The poll was conducted between July 7 and July 21, days after Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' was signed into law on Independence Day (July 4). The president's handling of key foreign and domestic issues were also reported to have low approval ratings including his handling of the situation in Iran (42%), foreign affairs (41%), immigration (38%), the economy (37%), the Israel-Palestine conflict (36%), foreign trade (36%), the Russia-Ukraine war (33%) and the federal budget (29%).

Trump was also reported to be losing support among male voters, according to the latest CBS News/YouGov poll released last week. Trump was reported to have a -6 net approval rating among men, with a 47% approval rating and a 53% disapproval rating, the highest of any point during his second term in office.

The president began his current term at a +20 margin, with a 60% approval rating and 40% disapproval rating among male voters. Additionally, men supported Trump by a wider margin in his 2024 presidential election victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris than in his 2020 loss to former President Joe Biden, having narrowly won men under the age of 50, a group that had previously favored Biden by 10 points, according to PewResearch.org.

Trump's shift among male voters has been consistent since April, with his approval rating dropping from 58% to 49% and his disapproval rating rising from 42% to 51% on April 11. Polling expert Nate Silver claimed that the president's approval rating has reportedly ""started to drop more quickly"" in the latest edition of his Silver Bulletin Substack released last Tuesday (July 22).

Trump's net approval rating is currently at -8.9, which is a drop of -2.0 points in one week and only 0.8 points higher than the -9.7 net approval low point of his second term reported on April 29, but still about seven points higher than the same point of his first term, according to Silver. The president has reportedly seen a decrease in support for several policies including immigration (-3.4 to -7.4), economy (-12.1 to -14.1), trade (-14.5 to -17.5) and inflation (-24.5 to -24.8).

Additionally, the percentage of Americans who strongly approve of Trump's job performance has dropped below 27% for the first time during his second term with about 43% of respondents claiming they strongly disapprove of him."

Lewis

Los Angeles Times

With the Jeffrey Epstein controversy still dogging him, President Donald Trump has embraced his favorite distraction: the culture wars.

It began when he announced that Coca-Cola was switching to cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup. Coke responded with a statement that basically boiled down to: “Wait, what?” — before announcing the company would release a Trump-approved version of the famous cola.

Now, you might think decisions like these should be left up to the companies. After all, it’s none of the government’s business, and Republicans supposedly believe in free markets.

But no! Trump followed up by threatening to block a new stadium for Washington’s NFL team unless it changed its name back to the Redskins. He also demanded that Cleveland’s baseball team go back to being called the Indians.

At first glance, this seems like a ridiculous ploy to distract us from Epstein. And sure, that’s part of the story. But here’s what Trump understands: A lot of Americans feel like somebody came along and stole all their cool stuff — iconic team names, high-hold hair spray, military bases named after Confederate generals — and replaced them with soulless, modern stuff. “Guardians,” “low-flow shower heads,” “Fort Liberty.”

We might laugh at his trivial Coke crusade, but sports teams evoke more primal emotions. You can drink a Coke today and a Pepsi tomorrow. But you can’t root for the Indians on Monday and the Detroit Tigers on Tuesday. Not unless you’re a psychopath — or someone who wants to get punched in a bar. Team loyalty matters.

Trump gets this. When I was a kid, the Redskins won three Super Bowls. There were songs like “Hail to the Redskins,” team heroes (like John Riggins, Doug Williams and coach Joe Gibbs), and all manner of burgundy and gold merch. It wasn’t just a team. It was part of our identity — as well as an excuse to spend time together (even as decades passed without another Super Bowl run).

Then one day: poof. Goodbye Redskins.

Now imagine that same sense of loss in an already deracinated place like the Rust Belt, where the ball club is a big part of the city’s identity, and where they already closed Dad’s factory and then had the gall to take his boyhood team’s name too.

This isn’t really about names. It’s about nostalgia. Tradition. Identity. It’s about trying to keep a tenuous grip on a world you can still recognize, while everything else dissolves into a place where even choosing a bathroom is a political statement.

Now, is the name Redskins offensive? Sure. Even though a 2016 Washington Post poll found that 9 out of 10 Native Americans weren’t offended, you’d be hard-pressed to defend it on the merits. But the Indians? Come on. Just lose the Chief Wahoo cartoon. This isn’t rocket science.

So is Trump onto something when it comes to the real-world backlash to overwrought political correctness? Yes. But he’s also profiting politically off of people pining for a world that never really existed.

I thought about this last fall when Trump worked the fry station and drive-through window at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania. At first, it seemed like just another stunt to troll Kamala Harris (who said she once worked for McDonald’s).

But then I saw him in that red apron with the yellow piping — still wearing his red tie, of course — and thought: This is Rockwell. This image evokes a time when a white guy of a certain age could sling burgers, go home to his wife and kids, mow his middle-class lawn, crack open a Coca-Cola, and watch the Redskins and the Cowboys.

Whether Trump consciously appreciates the power of this imagery, I don’t know. But he clearly understands that there is power in yearning, that culture is more primordial than American politics and that refusing to exploit these forces (out of some sense of propriety) would be a sucker’s move.

To some degree, he’s been playing this game for years — think energy efficient lightbulbs, paper straws and his criticism over Apple’s decision to get rid of the iPhone home button. If something new comes along, Trump is already up there stoking cultural outrage, blaming the “woke” left and demanding somebody bring him a Diet Coke. It’s what he does.

But here’s why this actually matters: These little skirmishes don’t just distract from the bigger, more dangerous stuff — they enable it.

Even as he accuses former President Barack Obama of treason (which is absurd and dangerous), Trump’s bond with his supporters is reinforced by these small, almost laughable grievances. He makes them feel seen, defended and nostalgic for a world that (to them, at least) made more sense.

That emotional connection with his base is what allows Trump to tell bigger lies and launch bolder attacks without losing them.

Coke and the Redskins may seem trivial. But they’re the sugar that helps the poison go down.

Since the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. government and federal law enforcement agencies have equated terrorism with Al Qaeda, the Islamic State, and other international extremist groups. As a result, many Americans have come to view terrorism as a uniquely Muslim phenomenon.

In the past week, news coverage has focused on horrific massacres at two New Zealand mosques, where 50 people were killed by a white supremacist. But these were only the latest in a long series of attacks that have gained international attention since the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, when another white supremacist drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing a young woman. In a single month last year, a Donald Trump supporter sent pipe bombs to Democratic Party leaders and critics of the president, and a man walked into a Pittsburgh synagogue and gunned down 11 worshippers in the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history. In the wake of these violent acts, the conversation about terrorism in the United States has slowly shifted to domestic extremists.

“The Threat Within” examines how the arbitrary nature of federal terrorism prosecutions has warped our understanding of ideologically inspired violence in the United States.

Read the Stories

An Intercept analysis of federal prosecutions since 9/11 found that the Justice Department has routinely declined to bring terrorism charges against right-wing extremists, even when their alleged crimes appear to have met the legal definition of domestic terrorism: ideologically motivated acts that are harmful to human life and intended to intimidate civilians, influence policy, or change government conduct. According to The Intercept’s review, the Justice Department applied anti-terrorism laws against only 34 of the 268 right-wing extremists prosecuted for such crimes in federal court since 9/11. In the same period, they used those laws against more than 500 alleged international terrorists. The double standard also shows up in the Justice Department’s use of the powerful material support law. More than 400 international terrorism defendants have faced material support charges since 9/11, but prosecutors have used the law in only one domestic terrorism case in the same time frame.

Current and former Justice Department officials have increasingly argued for a new federal domestic terrorism statute to help them better respond to right-wing threats. But the problem isn’t any lack of legal authority to go after such extremists; it’s that the government has allowed its biases to influence how it chooses which crimes to prosecute as terrorism and which offenders merit that emotionally charged label. Today, the Justice Department and the FBI are continuing their long history of exaggerating threats from radical environmentalists and other left-wing actors, even creating new extremist ideologies, such as “black identity extremism,” out of whole cloth. The Intercept’s analysis of 70 federal prosecutions of so-called eco-terrorists since 9/11, for instance, found that although the majority of defendants were not charged under anti-terrorism laws, they were repeatedly called terrorists by the Justice Department in public statements and internal communications — a designation that channeled resources into investigations of their crimes and, in some cases, increased the severity of their punishments. Meanwhile, prosecutors charged 17 defendants under an anti-terrorism law written with the help of industry that was designed exclusively to target animal rights activists.

What is abundantly clear from our analysis of this data is that terrorism is a political construct. “The Threat Within” demonstrates that what critics of the Patriot Act predicted has come to pass: The country’s anti-terrorism laws have been used disproportionately to punish people whose political views are unpopular or perceived as foreign.

ABOUT THE SERIES DATA

The Intercept’s reporting for this series was informed by the collection and analysis of data for federal prosecutions of domestic extremists since 9/11. Contributing writer Trevor Aaronson and researcher Margot Williams examined hundreds of prosecutions to identify crimes that appear to have met the Patriot Act definition of domestic terrorism: “acts dangerous to human life” intended to intimidate civilians or influence government in the service of a domestic extremist ideology. A second analysis, of federal prosecutions of radical environmentalists and animal rights activists, included cases that were prosecuted under the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act or its precursor, or described publicly by the Justice Department as domestic terrorism. The Intercept’s data can be downloaded for analysis from GitHub.

In compiling data of federal prosecutions, Aaronson and Williams relied primarily on U.S. District Court records. They also reviewed and incorporated data from similar lists of domestic terrorism defendants and cases produced by the Congressional Research Service, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Anti-Defamation League, Charles Kurzman of the University of North Carolina, J.J. MacNab of George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, Jesse Norris of the State University of New York at Fredonia, and Will Potter of the University of Michigan.

In addition, as part of this project, The Intercept analyzed an internal Justice Department database called the Legal Information Office Network System, or LIONS, which stores case data, including offense types, prosecutors assigned, and charges filed. Federal prosecutors label cases according to so-called indicators, one of which is “domestic terrorism.” The LIONS data reveals cases that the Justice Department views internally as domestic terrorism. While the Justice Department makes LIONS data publicly available, it does so only after removing defendant names and docket numbers, making detailed analysis impossible on its own. Akil Harris, a senior research engineer at The Intercept, was able to identify 752 defendants whose cases were marked by prosecutors as involving domestic terrorism; he did so by linking the LIONS database to the Federal Judicial Center’s Integrated Database, which contains defendant names and docket numbers. Harris was then able to match cases in LIONS with cases in the FJC database, giving journalists and researchers at The Intercept a unique window into how prosecutors classify terrorism cases within the Justice Department."

Rep. Dave Min was chatting with reporters at the US Capitol when the California Democrat was asked about whether he wants Kamala Harris to run for governor.

Suddenly, Min no longer had time to talk.

“I have no comment,” he said.

Asked what he thought a Harris run would mean for his own reelection prospects, Min repeated, “I have no comment on that, sorry,” and bolted onto the House floor, away from reporters.

Rep. George Whitesides, another Democratic freshman from California who beat an incumbent Republican by 8,000 votes, took a long pause before answering whether he wanted to see the former vice president run.

“I welcome her to the race. I’m just really focused on my own race, but if that’s what she feels calls to do, that’s her prerogative,” Whitesides told CNN.

As Harris deliberates on whether she should run for governor or hold out for another potential presidential bid, California Democrats are quietly asking themselves the same question. Her critics say that while she would be a favorite to win the governor’s race in a deep-blue state, possible ambivalence about her candidacy could hurt Democratic chances in swing districts as the party tries to retake the US House.

Some top donors and interest group leaders insist that Harris will have to answer for former President Joe Biden, whose decision to run for reelection before making way for her remains a sore subject for Democrats, and whether Harris could have done more to prevent President Donald Trump’s return to the White House.

Harris has plenty of allies who want to see her run. Several leading elected officials in the state told CNN that they do not believe the candidates already running have either the stature or experience to stand up to Trump’s pressure campaign against California on everything from immigration raids to funding cuts.

“As someone who served as district attorney, attorney general and senator from California, she would have the experience, leadership and understanding of the state legislature to tackle two of the biggest problems in the state: the lack of affordable housing and a sense of a lack of public safety,” said Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents the Silicon Valley area and has had an uneasy relationship with Harris at times.

Rep. Mike Levin, who held his San Diego County district by 17,000 votes last year, said he believed a Harris run could help in 2026.

“She knows the state well, she knows the electorate well and I think she’d be a very formidable candidate,” he said.

The Harris critics — few of whom will put their names to their complaints — are doing their own math: She would probably win if she runs, they say, but if she doesn’t generate enthusiasm or if she fires up Republicans, she could prove a drag on vulnerable Democrats like Min and Whitesides as well as State Assembly and State Senate districts where Democrats don’t have votes to spare.

“There’s no groundswell for her candidacy. In fact, I think it would only fire up Republicans and hurt our ability to win the four to five seats that we need to win to win the House and hold on to three seats that we just flipped in 2024,” said one California House Democrat who asked not to be named in order to speak candidly about a candidate widely expected to be the party’s front-runner if she enters the race. “She comes in with baggage.”

Part of the issue for many Californians, said Rep. Jimmy Gomez, who represents a reliably Democratic district in Los Angeles, is that no matter what kind of campaign Harris might run, people believe that being governor wasn’t her first choice.

“Once you’re the vice president of the United States, there’s only one place to go. It’s president,” Gomez told CNN. “For me, if I was vice president and all of a sudden I lose, it would be a fallback to me. I hate to put it so bluntly.”

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has had a tough relationship with her fellow San Francisco-rooted politician. Asked by CNN whether she wanted to see Harris run for governor as she left the Capitol last week, Pelosi said only, “I want her to do whatever she wants to do.”

Where Harris stands

Harris is once again earning her reputation for long, drawn-out deliberation.

Several people who have spoken to Harris told CNN she has asked them whether they think she should run. Some of those people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose private conversations, say they have turned the question back to her.

She has also reached out to former California governors to ask what she could get done on the job, though not all have agreed to speak with her about it.

Harris canceled a long-planned August vacation, a move that one person familiar with her deliberations does not mean she’s decided what to do. Besides talking about a potential governor’s race, that person said, Harris has in the last few weeks asked her closest aides for research and memos that outline other options.

Among those options: Starting a 501(c)(4) organization focused on the information ecosystem and how to empower younger voters while rethinking institutions key to democracy, creating a political action committee to raise money for other candidates, and doing a listening tour of Southern states with a 2028 presidential bid in mind. Her thinking, the person said, is that she would have time for all of these if she doesn’t run for governor.

While nursing some worries that Harris has let the governor’s race take shape too much in her absence, confidants have also kept tabs on the other candidates, who include former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, former US Rep. Katie Porter and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. Harris allies privately scoff at the insistence of several candidates that they’d remain in the race if she enters it or that they would retain much support if they did.

And few voters are focused on a governor’s race when the primary isn’t until next June. The top two finishers in that contest, regardless of party, will advance to the November 2026 ballot.

Supporters and rivals are not waiting for the fall book tour for Harris’ soon-to-be-published memoir or a decision on the race to choreograph around her. Several pro-Harris Democrats have been passing around numbers from private polls conducted for others in the state showing her popularity among Democrats is much higher than any declared candidate. Supporters of others have been seeding chatter that people don’t want her back on the ballot, often with data that shows a drop-off of support for Democrats across California races when she was the presidential nominee last year.

Burning over Trump’s time in office, Harris is eager to stay involved, several who have spoken with the former vice president told CNN. She wants to at least keep open the option for another White House campaign in the future.

That’s different, though, from delving back to the hand-to-hand politics that advisers feel this kind of run for governor would require, if only for Harris to stave off looking like she was taking the race for granted, and for grappling with big challenges in Sacramento that are getting bigger.

Harris’ decision is not just intertwined with closing the door on a 2028 presidential run, but weighed against the quieter, wealthier existence that key members of her family have suggested to others they’d prefer.

Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, a California Democrat, said that especially among fellow Black women she speaks with, “they’re still healing and they want to make sure that she is fully healed.”

“She should certainly run if that’s the thing that she wants to do. She is certainly California’s girl. We have been rooting for her for so long,” Kamlager-Dove said, adding that though she thinks having yet another big personality as governor is important, “those decisions are incredibly personal.”

The wildcard: redistricting

One factor in how vulnerable California Democrats feel about a Harris run wasn’t in the conversation just a few months ago: the prospect that their districts may be redrawn in the middle of the decade.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called a special session to consider a rare mid-decade redistricting at the behest of Trump and the Justice Department. Trump says he wants to eliminate as many as five Democratic seats in Texas ahead of the midterms. That’s led leaders of Democratic-run states — including California Gov. Gavin Newsom — to threaten their own redrawing of lines to push out Republicans.

In California, Democrats who won by small margins could face harder races as they lose friendly territory to other districts.

California Democrats who argued Harris’ weaknesses to CNN could not, when pressed, say any of the other candidates would be more of more help for down-ticket candidates. And Harris supporters point out that if the argument holds, any statewide dynamics are likely to be subsumed to nationalized energy in a midterm year when Democrats will be mobilizing to take the majority in the House as a check on Trump.

Rep. Mark Takano, who represents the Southern California city of Riverside, told CNN that not only does he hope Harris considers running, but that enthusiasm for her and for Democrats overall has resurged in the last few months in response to Trump.

“After the Los Angeles protests, the ‘No Kings’ march, any drift to the right among certain parts — Latinos, African Americans, Asians — I think that’s been staunched, to say the least, and it’s moved the other direction,” Takano said.

But Rep. Young Kim, a Republican who represents an Orange County seat that is once again near the top of Democrats’ wish list to flip, laughed when asked about Harris running.

“Seriously, good luck to her,” Kim said with a laugh. She clarified she was being sarcastic.

Trump's approval rating fell 10% since taking office in January, which includes a 17% decline among independents to 29%, matching his all-time lowest rating among the group. The president was, however, reported to have steady support among Republicans at 89%, while support among Democrats was consistently reported to be in the lower single digits, having dropped to 1% in June before increasing to 2% in July.

The poll was conducted between July 7 and July 21, days after Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' was signed into law on Independence Day (July 4). The president's handling of key foreign and domestic issues were also reported to have low approval ratings including his handling of the situation in Iran (42%), foreign affairs (41%), immigration (38%), the economy (37%), the Israel-Palestine conflict (36%), foreign trade (36%), the Russia-Ukraine war (33%) and the federal budget (29%).

Trump was also reported to be losing support among male voters, according to the latest CBS News/YouGov poll released last week. Trump was reported to have a -6 net approval rating among men, with a 47% approval rating and a 53% disapproval rating, the highest of any point during his second term in office.

The president began his current term at a +20 margin, with a 60% approval rating and 40% disapproval rating among male voters. Additionally, men supported Trump by a wider margin in his 2024 presidential election victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris than in his 2020 loss to former President Joe Biden, having narrowly won men under the age of 50, a group that had previously favored Biden by 10 points, according to PewResearch.org.

Trump's shift among male voters has been consistent since April, with his approval rating dropping from 58% to 49% and his disapproval rating rising from 42% to 51% on April 11. Polling expert Nate Silver claimed that the president's approval rating has reportedly ""started to drop more quickly"" in the latest edition of his Silver Bulletin Substack released last Tuesday (July 22).

Trump's net approval rating is currently at -8.9, which is a drop of -2.0 points in one week and only 0.8 points higher than the -9.7 net approval low point of his second term reported on April 29, but still about seven points higher than the same point of his first term, according to Silver. The president has reportedly seen a decrease in support for several policies including immigration (-3.4 to -7.4), economy (-12.1 to -14.1), trade (-14.5 to -17.5) and inflation (-24.5 to -24.8).

Additionally, the percentage of Americans who strongly approve of Trump's job performance has dropped below 27% for the first time during his second term with about 43% of respondents claiming they strongly disapprove of him."

Now, Democrats are debating their future election strategy, and a lot of the discussion is taking place on podcasts.

Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut has been talking for months on NPR and elsewhere about a Democratic Party that's more populist, attacking parts of the political system that don't work for most people, and more loudly pushing back against the Trump administration. Rahm Emanuel, a longtime party leader, went on Megyn Kelly's podcast and rejected some party orthodoxy on social issues. The authors Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson have appeared on a stream of podcasts to promote their book Abundance, arguing that progressive policies have stood in the way of progressive government.

Pete Buttigieg is making his own pitch in one of NPR's all-platform interviews. The past and possibly future presidential contender had a discussion that's available as an Up First podcast episode, a video on multiple platforms, and on the radio during Morning Edition. In his conversation with NPR, Buttigieg warned that Democrats can't, and shouldn't, try to restore everything in the government that President Trump has broken this year.

""You've got an administration that is burning down so many of the most important institutions that we have in this country, which is wrong,"" Buttigieg said in a Morning Edition interview in New York City. ""It is also wrong to imagine that we should have just kept everything going along the way it was.""

Below are four key points from a wide-ranging discussion on where his party stands and what to do now.

The status quo wasn't working

When Democrats took power in 2021, many viewed it as a restoration project: repairing and strengthening the institutions that Trump had damaged. Buttigieg no longer sees that as a fully realistic or even desirable goal. The Democrats, he said, have been ""too attached to a status quo that has been failing us for a long time."" That's one of the reasons Buttigieg gives for the party's defeat in 2024.

Now he talks about embracing change. ""It is wrong to burn down the Department of Education, but I actually think it's also wrong to suppose that the Department of Education was just right in 2024,"" he said. ""You could say the same thing about USAID. It is unconscionable that children were left to die by the abrupt destruction of USAID. Unconscionable. But it's also wrong to suppose that if Democrats come back to power, our project should be to just tape the pieces together just the way that they were.""

In effect, he's taking up former Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign slogan from 2024 — ""We're not going back"" — and applying it to a completely different situation.

The furor over the Epstein files reflects a larger loss of confidence

""A breakdown in societal trust"" is one of the reasons Buttigieg believes the Jeffrey Epstein scandal has such staying power. Many Americans don't trust their government generally, and don't believe assurances that the government has revealed all it knows about the financier and convicted sex offender who was connected to many of the wealthy and powerful, including his onetime friend Donald Trump, before his suicide in 2019.

President Trump's aides promised great revelations from the Epstein files, and many Trump supporters proved unwilling to accept it when the Trump administration failed to deliver.

Buttigieg admits that Epstein ""was historically more of an area of interest for the MAGA base"" than for Democrats, but defends Democrats' recent pressure on the president.

""You shouldn't have to be a Republican or a Democrat to care about making sure there's transparency on something as horrific as the abuses that happened. And to want to understand why an administration that promised to shed light on this decided not to,"" Buttigieg said.

Buttigieg also answered our questions about another issue of trust: whether members of the past administration obscured President Joe Biden's condition as he aged. The former transportation secretary insisted otherwise. ""I told the truth, which is that he was old. You could see that he was old. And also, when it came to my ability to do my job and have my boss, my president, support me in that job, I always got whatever I needed from him, from the Oval Office.""

He wants to push back on ""the politics of fear""

Buttigieg says the fear of political retribution, or even physical violence, ""is more real than at any point in my lifetime."" The fear of losing funding ""is already impacting who gets invited to speak at a university or who gets hired at a law firm. ... We can't allow that."" He added, ""The thing about the politics of fear is the more you give in to it, the worse it gets. The only antidote to a politics of fear is a politics of courage.""

Watch the beard for clues

In our video interview, we discussed a quirk of history. Before 1860, no president had a beard or mustache. From 1861 to 1913, nearly every president had facial hair. Then the trend passed, and no president in modern times has had facial hair.

Buttigieg has grown a beard since leaving office and is now one of several potential presidential contenders with facial hair, joining others who range from Ted Cruz to JD Vance.

Could the beardless streak since 1913 soon come to an end? Buttigieg avoided saying whether he would shave the beard to run in 2028 — and also avoided saying whether he would run.

Roy Cooper will run for the U.S. Senate in North Carolina, giving Democrats a proven statewide winner in an open-seat race that is expected to be one of the most competitive 2026 contests.

Cooper made the announcement Monday with a video released on social media and his campaign website. The former two-term governor will immediately become the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in the race to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Thom Tillis.

Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley plans to run for the GOP nomination, with President Donald Trump's blessing, according to two people familiar with his thinking who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly before an official announcement.

Whatley, the former North Carolina GOP chairman, received Trump's endorsement after the president's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, passed on the seat.

Cooper's candidacy is a big recruiting win for Democrats, who see the open seat as a top pick-up opportunity in what will be a challenging year. To retake the majority in 2026, Democrats need to net four seats, and most of the contests are in states that Trump easily won last year. Trump won North Carolina by about 3 percentage points, one of his closest margins of victory.

Trump endorsed Whatley on his Truth Social platform Thursday night, posting that should he run, ""Mike would make an unbelievable Senator from North Carolina.""

Ex-U.S. Rep. Wiley Nickel already has been campaigning for the Democratic nomination for months. Party primaries would be March 3.

Cooper, 68, has been on statewide ballots going back a quarter-century — serving 16 years previously as attorney general before being first elected governor in 2016.

With a political career going back nearly 40 years, Cooper has had a knack for winning in a state where the legislature and appeals courts are now dominated by Republicans. State law barred Cooper from seeking a third consecutive gubernatorial term. He spent the spring on a teaching gig at Harvard.

State and national Democrats were longing for Cooper to join the race well before Tillis announced June 29 that he would not seek a third term. That news came after Trump threatened to back a primary candidate against him as Tillis opposed Medicaid reductions in the president's tax break and spending cut package,

Democrats haven't won a Senate race since 2008 in North Carolina, where independent voters tend to vote Republican in federal elections. Statewide races can be financially exorbitant because there are so many television markets — hundreds of millions of dollars are expected to be spent in the race.

Cooper's recent political history has painted him as a fighter against what he's considered extreme Republican policies, while at times finding consensus with GOP rivals.

When asked by The Associated Press last December about a Senate bid, Cooper replied: ""If you're going to run for public office again, you must have your heart and soul in it, you must have the fire in the belly.""

As governor he steered the state through the coronavirus pandemic, Hurricanes Helene and Florence and a law that became an early flashpoint in the culture wars over access to public restrooms by transgender people. That ""bathroom bill"" was rolled back early in Cooper's first term, and the state's economy soared during Cooper's tenure, marked by big jobs announcements and low unemployment.

While Cooper also managed to get Medicaid expansion approved and a landmark greenhouse gases law enacted, he fell short in stopping legislation that widely expanded private school vouchers and narrowed abortion rights.

Cooper's perceived accomplishments raised his national profile in 2024, making him as a potential running mate for Kamala Harris until he said it ""just wasn't the right time"" for him and for North Carolina.

Republicans have argued that Cooper remains susceptible politically, citing what they consider an extreme record supporting abortion rights and opposing school choice that led to many vetoes.

They've also cited a gubernatorial administration marked by spending overruns at the state Department of Transportation; its response to Helene and delays in rebuilding or renovating homes after Hurricanes Matthew and Florence; and executive orders that restricted businesses and school instruction during COVID-19. As for the roaring economy, Republicans credit themselves through lower taxes and deregulation.

Tillis' retirement announcement heartened far-right Republicans and strong Trump supporters who have been unhappy for years with his willingness to challenge Trump's actions and his Cabinet agency choices.

Republicans had deferred to the president's daughter-in-law Lara Trump, who is a North Carolina native, North Carolina State University graduate and a popular former RNC co-chair with Whatley during the 2024 election campaign. She posted on the social media platform X on Thursday that she would not seek the Senate seat."

In the last few weeks, we have seen two incredibly strong candidates, Rep. Jenna Jacobson in the 17th District and Rep. Robyn Vining in the 5th District, launch their campaigns for State Senate in districts that were won by Vice President Harris, Senator Baldwin, and Justice Crawford in the last few months.

As a result of Wisconsin’s Fair Maps, Senate Dems made massive gains in the chamber in 2024, and now only need to flip two seats to win a majority. Wisconsinites are taking note as it becomes clearer every day that we have the maps, the candidates, the message, and the support to win a Senate majority for the first time in over 10 years.

Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Wisconsin Democrats launch push to take the majority in the Senate after years in the shadows

For the first time in more than a decade, Wisconsin Democrats have a fighting chance at winning a majority in the state Senate, with four close seats on the ballot in 2026.

“Everyone agrees that the Wisconsin Senate is the most flippable chamber in the country,” Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein, D-Middleton, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Days after the budget was signed, Rep. Jenna Jacobson, D-Oregon, announced plans to challenge Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, a co-chair of the Legislature’s powerful Joint Finance Committee, for the 17th District seat. And Rep. Robyn Vining, D-Wauwatosa, will run in the 5th District, currently held by Sen. Rob Hutton, R-Brookfield, and thought to be the most “flippable” in the state.

“After 15 years of fighting, we finally have a chance to win,” Vining told supporters as she announced her campaign at a park in Wauwatosa. “The path to the Democratic majority, the path to fully funding our public schools, the path to fighting back against gun violence with meaningful reforms, the path to quality, affordable health care and mental health care and child care runs straight through the 5th Senate District.”

“Schools have been underfunded. Health care costs too much. Rent costs too much. Groceries cost too much. And a Democratic majority means that those issues are going to be addressed, and we’re going to start delivering for folks where Republicans have been dropping the ball,” Karcz said.

“We just passed yet another state budget on a Republican playing field, and I don’t want to do that again. No matter how hard we negotiate, we’re still on a Republican playing field, and the Republican playing field has been bad for Wisconsin families,” Vining said. “There is so much good that we can do if Democrats win the majority in the Wisconsin State Legislature, our job for the next 16 months is to tell people what that is like. It’s our job to cast that vision.”
